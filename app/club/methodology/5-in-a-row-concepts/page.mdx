# "5-in-a-row" Concept
## Body Posture

In terms of posture, there are three ways in which players can manipulate their centre of gravity. The positions adopted by players are directly related to their physical abilities and morphology.

The most common body posture is similar to a sprint athlete, in which the centre of gravity is supported by the quadriceps and glutes in a semi-squatting position. The feet should be alight with the shoulders but not in line, knees slightly bent and the body should be slightly point forward. This position allows the player to have a low point of gravity, maintain stability and react swiftly in any direction. It also provides a great body weight transfer into the ball, generating more power on each shot. This is called the ready position, it aims to maintain balance, agility and react quickly to each ball.  However, in this stance it is important that the student has strength and muscular endurance in the quadriceps and glutes.

There is also a more upright posture in which the centre of gravity is higher and more closed. This is the position adopted by Paquito Navarro, for example, where the player brings his feet closer together and bends his knees less, increasing mobility but decreasing stability. This stance often involves excessive use of the wrist, forearm and lower back to perform negative-negative pole strokes, which can increase the risk of injury.

The third position consists of a greater distance between the legs, with the adductors being the most used muscles, and is used by Fernando Belasteguín, for example. This stance is characterised by greater stability but less mobility, and requires a greater ability to anticipate and read the opponent's movement.

**Body profile**

By definition the body profile is the position that the player takes prior to the technical execution of a shot. It can be more open or more closed, according to the intention he wants to give to the shot.

An open profile has great advantage, as it allows the player to better hide the intention of the shot, having a greater peripheral view of the opponents and the whole field.

When a player presents a closed profile, where the feet are aligned, it causes the player to lose stability, self-induces a dead angle and increases the risk of injury, because the body rotation will be limited associated with the knee and hip. With a close position it is much easier for the opponents to read the play and react to it, because the options for that shot are limited by that position.

We can make a comparison with soccer, when a player makes a pass in a crossed, straight or inverted direction, he tends to adapt a body position for each of them.
At a more advanced level there is the art of deception where the player presents a more neutral position, absorbing more information to then choose the best shot for each situation.

## Racket positioning and grip

Some rackets present two different geometric figures on the handle, a circle and an octagon. The circle is more difficult to identify the handle because it has no edges, while the octagon has edges. The counting of these edges is done clockwise, with the initial bevel corresponding to 1 and so on. By selecting a phase we will have different types of grip positions.
The Eastern grip is defined by placing the base knuckle of the index finger on the third bevel of the racket handle.
The Backhand grip is defined by placing the index finger on the second bevel of the handle.
The Continental grip is defined by placing the base knuckle of the index finger on the first or second bevel of the racket handle.
For a left handed player the counting is done counterclockwise being the Easter Grip on the seventh bevel, the Backhand Grip on the first bevel and the Continental Grip on the eighth bevel.

The implementation of the Eastern grip in padel facilitates power and control in the execution of forehand ground shots and lobs on the left side of the body. This advantage arises from the alignment of the racket's face with the ball. However, it is suboptimal for backhand shots due to the closed orientation of the racket's face on the left side. Consequently, players using this grip often will try to adjust the racket for backhand shots, which can potentially result in injuries.

The Backhand grip, as denoted by its name, optimises the execution of backhand shots and lobs on the right side of the player's body. However, it is suboptimal for forehand shots.

The Continental grip, positioned on the second bevel of the octagon-shaped handle, achieves a consistent alignment of the racket face on both sides. This alignment ensures a direct connection between the racket face and the ball. By manipulating the hand angle, we can apply flat, slice, or topspin strokes, imparting varied effects on the ball.

The hand position alongside the racket handle is also important. If we put the hand further up the handle we will have more control and power when blocking the ball. The lower we hold the racket the more handling and flexibility we will have, facilitating aerial and more angled strokes.

To ensure proper hand placement, it is important to release the index finger and thumb while grabbing the racket handle. The racket should be supported solely by the three fingers below, namely the middle finger, ring finger, and little finger. These three fingers serve as stabilisers and provide support to the racket. The index finger and thumb metaphorically represent a trigger when in an open position. This trigger mechanism is crucial for maintaining control over the racket head, as its absence can result in a loss of control.

## Types of movement

Padel is a fast-paced sport that requires players to be able to move quickly and efficiently in all directions. It's a game that necessitates players to maintain a complete 360-degree awareness of the court, as opposed to merely 180 degrees. This means that players need to be aware of their surroundings and be able to move in any direction at any time.

One important thing that players need to do is to be able to read the opponent's shots in order to get into position early or to react quickly to the opponent’s shot. To perceive the court at 360 degrees, players need to develop good footwork and mobility. This means being able to move quickly in all directions and to change direction quickly.

**Frontal Mobility**

This type of movement begins from a neutral position, where the opponent shot compels the player to move towards the ball. The field of movement lies between the player and the net. To execute this effectively, the player need to accelerate promptly, ensuring that the racket face aligns precisely with the imaginary trajectory of the ball. Frontal mobility is instrumental in closing the gap and seizing control of the point.

**Diagonal Movement**

Diagonal movement unfolds when the ball's trajectory deviates on the side walls. This prompts a pivot rotation of the hips and limbs, causing the player’s chest to turn sideways, thus initiating a small diagonal shift. It's a strategic movement used to maintain an optimal position and respond to balls that deflect from the intended path.

**Moving Backwards**

Moving backward involves executing a pivot step and a reaction step. At the outset, the reaction step is relatively wide, creating additional space between the player and the ball. This allows players to handle faster incoming shots. In situations where the ball falls within the player's technical range, smaller adjustment steps toward the back wall might be needed to effectively maintaining control and court coverage.

**Lateral Steps**

Lateral steps are similar from tennis and are characterized by the open-stance position. This technique allows players to keep their atention fixed on the opponent's court while exerting pressure on the opponent's actions. It entails lateral foot movements without crossing, facilitating efficient hip and waist rotation over the ball. Players can use these movements to cover ground quickly, react to angled shots, and create opportunities for offensive shots.

## Impact points

The impact points on ground shots are specific positions where the racket makes contact with the ball during different phases of the shot. The impact point holds considerable influence over the shot's direction, power, and control. In the case of ground shots, a conceptual line is drawn parallel to the player's shoulders, resulting in four distinct impact points.

The initial impact point is located between the player's shoulders. The second impact point aligns with the player's front shoulder. The third impact point is positioned at a distance equivalent to the length of the racket handle in front of the player's body. The fourth impact point occurs when the player's arm is nearly fully extended.

For aerial shots, we divide the space into four quadrants. Shots are primarily executed in the first quadrant, between the 12 o'clock and 3 o'clock positions. For left-handed players, shots are executed in the fourth quadrant, between the 9 o'clock and 12 o'clock positions.

These impact point locations are subjective and should be adjusted to suit each player's unique anatomy. Furthermore, it should be noted that the same impact point can yield different directions depending on the player's side.

## Terminations

The terminations of movements in Padel shots are crucial for both technique and strategy. Properly executed terminations can make the difference between an effective shot and one that leaves you vulnerable to your opponents.

**Follow-through:** After striking the ball, players should extend their arm and racket towards the target with a smooth, controlled motion. A complete follow-through not only aids in shot accuracy but also allows for a seamless transition into the ready position for the next shot.

**Weight transfer:** Efficient weight transfer is essential in Padel. When terminating a shot, it's important to transfer your body weight onto your front foot (the foot on the same side as your striking hand). This ensures stability and balance after the shot, enabling players to quickly react to the following play.

**Timing and balance:** The timing of your termination, in sync with your shot, is of utmost importance. Balancing your body weight and coordinating the termination with the point of contact ensures better control and accuracy.

**Recovery and court positioning:** Following the shot termination, players should swiftly recover to a neutral and balanced position. This facilitates readiness for the opponent's response and allows for effective court coverage. Maintaining optimal court positioning is fundamental to your overall strategy.

**Shot selection:** The type of termination can vary depending on the shot choice. For example, when executing a lob shot, players may incorporate a higher, more vertical termination to create elevation. In contrast, a smash shot may involve a more downward termination with a focus on power and placement.

**Disguising intentions:** A vital aspect of shot termination in Padel is to disguise your intentions from your opponents. This involves using similar-looking terminations for various shot choices. By doing so, you can keep your adversaries guessing and maintain a tactical advantage.

Shot termination involves elements of technique, strategy and positioning. Adapting to the speed, angle and position of the ball is a critical aspect of finishing and can significantly improve a player's performance on court.
