# Coaching Aspects

## Types of Feedback

While technique and strategy are crucial, feedback is an essential tool in coaching, and it can be delivered in various forms. It is important for a coach to be adaptable and use a combination of feedback types to effectively support their students' learning and skill development. In padel coaching, we will explore the four main types of feedback: visual, auditory, tactile, and kinesthetic (also known as kinaesthetic). The art of coaching lies in the ability to use these different types of feedback effectively. No two players are the same, and what works wonders for one may not be as impactful for another. A skilled tennis coach understands the various learning styles and preferences of their students and adapts their feedback accordingly, ensuring that each player can reach their full potential.
### Visual Feedback

Visual feedback is provided through what the player can see. It can effectively demonstrate proper body positioning, stroke mechanics, and court positioning. This type of feedback is especially helpful for visual learners who learn best by observing and understanding the intricacies of their actions and their relationship to the desired outcome. To optimize the advantages of visual feedback, coaches often utilize slow-motion footage or side-by-side comparisons to highlight the disparities between a player's execution and the ideal technique.
### Auditory Feedback

Auditory feedback is delivered through sound. This type of feedback can include verbal instructions or cues from the coach. For example, the coach might provide instructions on the timing of a swing, positional corrections, type of stroke to play or offer encouragement through words of motivation.

This type of feedback is especially useful for players who respond well to spoken guidance and who benefit from a coach's verbal presence. These individuals often find that the coach's words help them stay focused, motivated, and oriented during practice and matches.
### Tactile Feedback

Tactile feedback involves physical touch or contact. In padel, this could involve the coach making slight adjustments to a player's grip, posture, or stance by physically guiding them. It's a hands-on approach that can help the player feel the correct movements and positions.

For some players, tactile feedback can be immensely effective, especially when they're struggling with specific aspects of their technique. The physical interaction helps them understand the correct feel and muscle memory required for a particular movement. It's like learning through touch, enabling players to connect what they feel with what they see and hear.
### Kinaesthetic (Knesic) Feedback

Kinaesthetic, or kinesthetic, feedback relates to the body's sensation of movement and position. It involves helping the player develop a "feel" for their body's movements. This type of feedback might involve asking the player how a particular movement feels to them or encouraging them to focus on the sensation of a well-executed shot.

This type of feedback is particularly beneficial for players who are highly in tune with their bodies. They can use this type of feedback to develop a more profound understanding of their physical actions and connect their bodily sensations to specific outcomes on the court. It's about developing a "feel" for their movements.

## Ball throwing techniques

At an amateur level, the padel coach should tailor their training and practice sessions to meet the specific needs and skill levels of the players. Remember, coaching at the amateur level is about fostering a love for the sport, nurturing skills, and creating a positive learning environment. With a patient and understanding approach, the coach can help amateur padel players develop their game and enjoy their journey in the sport.

### When should we throw the ball by the floor?

Training a student without a padel racket in hand as a teaching technique is a valuable method for introducing and familiarising beginners or individuals with specific challenges to the technical aspects of padel without the added complexity of holding a racket.

Students who are new to the sport or lack experience with sports teams can benefit from it as it provides a clear and visual way to understand the technical movements and concepts. It provides a controlled environment where the student can focus solely on understanding and processing various padel variables without the added pressure of hitting the ball.

For students with coordination challenges or poor muscular tone, it helps them develop muscle memory and coordination by repetitively simulating the movements without the added weight and complexity of the racket. For students who are new to padel, it reduces the risk of accidents or injuries that could occur when learning with a racket in hand.

Coaches can closely observe the student's movements during shadow practice and provide immediate feedback on technique, enabling the student to make adjustments and improvements.

As the students progress and become more familiar with the technical aspects, they can gradually transition to incorporating the racket and the ball into their practice sessions.

### When should we throw the ball with the hand?

Throwing the ball with the hand for these players can be an essential technique to help beginner students build confidence and develop the necessary technical skills without the added complexities of footwork and racket handling initially.

For this first approach the coach and the student should be on the same side of the court and near at approximately 4 meters from the net.

By throwing the ball in a controlled and close proximity, the coach can create a positive learning environment where the student focus is solely on hitting the ball successfully. This early sense of achievement boosts the student's confidence and encourages them to continue learning and improving.

For beginners who have no sports background or are uncoordinated, starting with the hand-thrown ball eliminates the complexity of learning footwork and racket techniques all at once. It allows the student to concentrate solely on the contact point and basic swing mechanics.

The feeling of successfully hitting the ball over the net is an important milestone for beginners. This achievement can provide a sense of joy and achievement, motivating them to continue practising and learning. As the student experiences success through hand-throw exercises, they begin to develop a positive mindset, believing in their ability to improve and excel in the sport.

When the student is comfortable throwing the ball and the technical movement associated, the coach can introduce new concepts as ball lecture, footwork and technique. As a progression, the coach goes to the other side of the net and throws ball to the student.

Once the student becomes comfortable with hitting the ball and has gained confidence in the technical movement associated with it, the coach can progress to introduce new concepts and challenges to further develop the player's skills.

To challenge the student further, the coach moves to the opposite side of the net and throws balls to the student. This helps the student practice hitting balls coming from a different direction, simulating real match situations.

Initially, the focus is on the student getting comfortable with hitting the hand-thrown ball and gaining confidence in executing the basic swing mechanics.
Once the student feels more at ease, the coach can introduce new concepts such as ball lecture (the different types of balls received), footwork (movement and positioning on the court), and technique (specific shot mechanics).

As the student progresses, the coach can incorporate game-based drills, where the student practices specific techniques and skills in the context of simulated game scenarios. The coach gradually introduces more complex drills and exercises, encouraging the student to adapt and improve their decision-making skills and shot selection.

Throughout the progression, the coach provides continuous feedback and guidance, helping the student refine their technique, strategy, and overall gameplay.

### When should we throw the ball with the racket?

The progression from hand-thrown balls to using a padel racket introduces a new level of difficulty and complexity to the training process. It is essential for the coach to ensure that the student is ready for this advancement and that they have a solid foundation in fundamental skills. Once the student has demonstrated improved ability to control the ball and has developed a level of proficiency in different technical aspects of padel, the coach can progress to the next stage of training, which involves throwing the ball with the racket.

As the student's skills and confidence improve, the coach can increase the level of demand and challenge. This progression involves increasing the distance between the coach and the student, from white-line to white-line, which provides more space for the student to practice and refine their shots. With the increased distance between the coach and the student, the padel racket allows the student to execute shots with better control and precision.

The student's technical evolution progresses as they face greater challenges with increased distance and use of the padel racket. The student must now combine their various technical skills, footwork, perception, ball lecture, impact point, and more, to successfully hit the ball.

The coach introduces more complex drills and challenges to test the student's technical abilities and depth of understanding. This may involve practicing shots from different court positions and situations to ensure the student can handle varying game scenarios.

The second stage of training, characterised by an interaction between the padel trainer and the student, is a crucial step in bridging the gap between controlled practice and real game situations for amateur players. This stage introduces a more dynamic and realistic training environment, challenging the student to handle a small quantity of balls exchanged with the coach.

In this stage, the coach and the student interact with each other by exchanging a small number of balls, usually 1 to 3 at a time. This creates a more dynamic practice scenario that closely resembles the real gameplay. The training scene becomes closer to an actual playing circumstance, providing a significant challenge for the amateur player. This closer simulation helps the student adapt to real-game situations more effectively.

The coach adjusts the ball speed and intensity of play to a level that the student can handle while still presenting an acceptable level of ball control. By focusing on exchanging a small quantity of balls, the student starts building essential ball exchange skills, such as anticipating the ball's trajectory, positioning on the court, and decision-making.

This stage acts as a bridge between more controlled practice methods, like hand-thrown balls or balls from a basket, and fully live ball exercises where the student faces unpredictable shots and situations. The student starts developing court awareness, learning to read the game, and understanding the importance of tactical positioning and shot selection.

This stage plays a crucial role in preparing the student for more advanced training and real-game situations. The gradual progression from controlled drills to interactive ball exchanges helps the student build confidence, adaptability, and resilience in their padel gameplay. The coach's role is to provide appropriate challenges and guidance, ensuring that the student continues to grow and improve as they advance through this stage of training.

### When should we start with live ball exercises?

Initiating live ball exercises in padel is a crucial step in a student's training, and it should only be done when the student meets specific criteria regarding their technical, tactical, physical, and mental attributes. These criteria ensure the student can handle challenges presented by live ball exercises and derive maximum benefit from this phase of training.

The student should demonstrate a solid level of technical proficiency, including the ability to control various variables such as ball direction, speed, height, depth, posture, grip and comfortable impact zone. This level of control is crucial in handling the unpredictability of live ball exchanges.

The student needs to comprehend basic tactical concepts, like maintaining consistency and minimizing unforced errors, by exchanging at least eight balls over the net with the coach. This indicates the student's ability to sustain rallies and apply basic tactics during gameplay.

To meet the demands of dynamic gameplay, students undergoing live ball exercises must have adequate levels of physical fitness that include endurance, speed, and agility. This ensures that students can keep pace with the demands of dynamic gameplay.

Maintaining mental resilience is crucial for students to cope with challenging emotions and experiences that arise while learning. To persevere through frustrations, anxieties, and other emotions that may arise during live ball exercises, students must have mental strength.

It is important to note that the criteria for fitness levels and emotional resilience may vary based on the individual student's progress, dedication, and natural abilities. Padel coaches must carefully evaluate each student's readiness for live ball exercises and provide tailored guidance and support to help them achieve the required standards.

Live ball training creates a realistic and dynamic training environment where students can apply their technical and tactical skills in real game situations. When the student meets the required criteria, they can benefit greatly from this phase of training. This further improves their padel skills and enhances their understanding of the sport. The coach should create a supportive and challenging environment that encourages students to continuously improve and grow in their padel journey.

## Alternatives to the Basket

The use of the basket in training is one of the most commonly used techniques in padel, tennis and other racket sports. There are two types of basket that are often used: the traditional basket and the waist basket.

When using the traditional basket, there are two basic things to remember. Firstly, the basket must be placed at an angle that allows the coach access to the basket to make it easier to throw the ball. Secondly, the basket must be on the side of the coach's non-dominant hand so that the exercise can be carried out quickly. The use of the traditional basket is often considered as an "anchor", as it doesn't allow the coach the same mobility and variability of positions as the waist basket.

The waist basket is an alternative to the traditional basket that allows the coach greater mobility on the pitch. It is a more dynamic method as it offers different angles of reception and reaction for the students, replicating possible game situations in a more realistic way.

It's important that the coach chooses the most appropriate tool for the objectives set for each lesson and for each student.

Another tool that coaches use in padel lessons is the tube. This technique consists of throwing balls through a tube placed over the shoulder of the coach, who drops the balls and then hits them to the student.

# Transversal Concepts

## Shot direction (parallel, middle, cross)

The direction of a shot in padel relies on the coordination of four key elements: the body profile, the face of the racket, the impact point on the ball, and the termination of the movement. These aspects play a fundamental role in a player's ability to control the direction and precision rate of their shots.

Precision, in the context of padel, refers to a player's skill in hitting the ball into a very specific and small target area. It reflects the player's ability to place the ball precisely where they intend to, even in tight and challenging spots on the court. Precision is crucial for executing tactical plays and exploiting opponents' weaknesses.

On the other hand, accuracy is related to a player's consistency in hitting the ball close to the intended target, even if they don't hit the exact spot they are aiming for. It measures how well a player can consistently hit the ball in the vicinity of their target, even if not every shot is perfectly on target.

Both precision and accuracy are valuable qualities for a padel player. Precision allows players to execute intricate shots with finesse and control, while accuracy ensures that even if a shot isn't perfectly placed, it remains close enough to keep the opponent under pressure and maintain tactical advantage.

The parallel direction of a shot in padel is influenced by the side of the court on which the player is positioned. The face of the racket plays a crucial role in determining the shot's direction, as it should point forward in the desired target direction.

For a left-side player (backhand on the left side), when executing a parallel shot, the impact point on the ball is typically one handle in front of the body. This position allows the player to strike the ball at an optimal angle to direct it parallel to the side wall, maintaining control and precision over the shot. For a left-side player to execute a parallel shot hitting the ball on the right side (forehand on the left side), the impact point should be between the shoulders.

For a right-side player (forehand on the right side), the impact point on the ball for a parallel shot is typically between the shoulders. This positioning enables the player to generate power and control, sending the ball parallel to the side wall on the opposite side of the court. For a right-side player to execute a parallel shot hitting the ball on the left side (backhand on the right side), the impact point should be one handle in front of the body.

The middle direction of a shot, also known as the central or down-the-middle shot, is a crucial aspect of strategic play in padel. Similar to the parallel and cross-court directions, the face of the racket should be pointed to the direction the player wants to give to the shot, which is typically the middle of the court or the back glass 3.

For both right-side and left-side players, the impact point on the ball should be in line with their front shoulder. This means that for a right-side player, the ball must be aligned with their left shoulder, while for a left-side player, the ball must be aligned with their right shoulder. This alignment ensures that the player can accurately direct the ball down the middle of the court.

For a right-side player (forehand on the right side), to execute a cross-court shot on the forehand side, the impact point on the ball should be one handle in front of the body. On the other hand, for a left-side player (forehand on the left side), to hit a cross-court shot on the forehand side, the impact point on the ball should be between the shoulders. This positioning allows the player to create the necessary angle to direct the ball diagonally across the court to the opposite side.

For the backhand shot the positioning is inversely proportional to the forehand shot. In summary, for both right-side and left-side players, the impact points for cross-court shots are as follows:

- Right-side player (forehand on the right side): One handle in front of the body.
- Left-side player (forehand on the left side): Between the shoulders.
- Right-side player (backhand on the right side): Between the shoulders.
- Left-side player (backhand on the left side): One handle in front of the body.

Regardless of the direction a player wants to hit the ball, maintaining proper body positioning, racket face alignment, and termination of the racket tip are crucial for executing successful shots in padel.

The player's body should be positioned in a way that aligns with the intended shot direction. Proper footwork and body rotation are essential to achieve the desired angle and control over the shot. For a parallel shot, the player's body is typically facing the side wall, with the feet more aligned towards the wall. This positioning allows the player to hit the ball parallel to the side wall, maintaining control and precision over the shot. As the player opens up the angle to play a middle or cross-court shot, their body adopts a more open position, facing forward towards the net. The feet are adjusted to align with the desired shot direction. This body positioning enables the player to generate the necessary angle to direct the ball diagonally across the court to the middle or the opposite side.

The face of the racket must be adjusted to the direction the player wants to give to the shot. The correct racket face alignment allows the player to control the ball's trajectory and spin.

The termination of the racket tip and body weight transfer are crucial in determining the direction a player wants to give to the shot, regardless of whether they are hitting on the forehand or backhand side. The way the player finishes the swing impacts the shot's accuracy and control.

## Shot depth and height

The height of the ball in padel shots is determined by the termination of the racket's tip, which should fall between the front shoulder and the waist level. This range ensures optimal ball height over the net and prevents the ball from hitting the net or the back wall. If the shot terminates below waist height, it is likely the ball will not clear the net, while terminating above the front shoulder will result in the ball hitting the back wall.

Maintaining proper form and technique is crucial in every ground shot, be it defensive or offensive. The termination of the racket swing should be accompanied by a slight bend in the torso and supporting limbs, aligning the shoulders obliquely. This alignment contributes to shot control and consistency.

However, there are exceptions, such as the lob shot, where the termination of the racket swing can pass the shoulder line. In the lob, coordination between the upper arm movement and the supporting limbs is vital to execute the shot effectively.

Shot depth is influenced by the point of impact on the ball. Hitting the ball further forward will reduce the distance it travels, while hitting it further back will increase the depth. The impact point on the ball should be coordinated with the alignment of the shoulders. If the ball is struck too early with the shoulders pointing down, it will hit the net. Conversely, if the ball is struck early with the correct shoulder position, it will still fall quickly but with more distance. Therefore, synchronising the shoulder position with the impact point on the ball is essential to control the depth of the shot.

In padel, precision and technique play significant roles in shot execution. A thorough understanding of these factors enables players to adjust their shots according to the situation and execute strategic plays on the court.

## Ball Effects

There are four generic effects that we can apply in padel. We can consider the flat effect, which is a movement where the racket enters through the centre of the ball and there is very little twisting of the wrist and forearm at the moment of impact, where the racket comes out as a straight line. If we imagine a padel ball and consider physical vectors where it has a start, a direction and an end, we can consider the start of the vector at the centre of the ball and the end would be on the opposite side of the ball or if the ball was broken from one side to the other.

With the slice effect, like the plane effect, the first contact of the racquet with the ball is in the centre, but the wrist and forearm twist underneath the ball. Again, if we were to use a vector, the start of the vector would be at the front of the ball and the end would be a small curve that goes under the ball and ends in the same direction as the plane effect.

Then there is the side effect, as the name suggests and which can be misleading, the ball is hit from the side but the first contact with the ball is not from the side, it is from the centre and then the twist that comes from the wrist and the forearm starts in the direction of the right side of the ball as if we were cutting at 2 or 3 o'clock and it also ends in the direction of the flat and slice effect. The start of the vector would be in the centre of the ball with a curve, starting with a curve to the right side of the ball and ending in the centre again.

Then there is the lift effect, when we talk about lifting the ball, contrary to what people might think, it means hitting the ball in the centre and the vector now rises to the top of the ball, between 12 and 1 o'clock if it were a clock. The aim is to brush the ball and ensure rotation, which characterises this lift effect by its ability to make the ball bounce more than usual.

-- colocacao de diagrama de efeitos

## Speed types (1, 2, 3, 4, 5)

The categorization of speeds is an essential aspect for players to determine their strategy and positioning on the court. It involves considering three variables: depth, number of ball bounces on the ground, and length of ball rebound on the glass.

Let's start with **Speed 1**, which represents the lowest speed level that a player can apply to the ball. At this speed, the player aims to make the ball bounce three times on the ground before it reaches the back glass.

Moving on to **Speed 2**, players can now make the ball bounce twice on the ground before it reaches the back glass. This enables them to add more power and unpredictability to their shots, keeping the opponent on their toes.

In **Speed 3**, players can make the ball bounce only once on the ground before it reaches the back glass and have the ability to rebound the ball up to the red zone of the defense. This speed requires precision and accuracy, as it allows for quick and aggressive shots.

As we progress to **Speed 4**, the player's control and technique become even more refined, with the ball making a single bounce on the ground, and ensuring that it rebounds above the white line. This level of speed demands a balance between power and finesse, making it a challenging yet rewarding skill to master.

Finally, we have **Speed 5**, which represents the highest level of speed and acceleration. At this level, players can produce an increase in acceleration that allows the ball to bounce once on the ground, rebound on the back wall, and approach the net. This speed requires exceptional timing and technique, as it can catch the opponent off guard and create scoring opportunities.

The categorization of speeds provides players with a framework to assess their shots and adjust their gameplay accordingly. It is an important aspect of the game, allowing players to strategically capitalize on their opponent's weaknesses and increase their chances of winning.

# "5-in-a-row" Concept
## Body Posture

In terms of posture, there are three ways in which players can manipulate their centre of gravity. The positions adopted by players are directly related to their physical abilities and morphology.

The most common body posture is similar to a sprint athlete, in which the centre of gravity is supported by the quadriceps and glutes in a semi-squatting position. The feet should be alight with the shoulders but not in line, knees slightly bent and the body should be slightly point forward. This position allows the player to have a low point of gravity, maintain stability and react swiftly in any direction. It also provides a great body weight transfer into the ball, generating more power on each shot. This is called the ready position, it aims to maintain balance, agility and react quickly to each ball.  However, in this stance it is important that the student has strength and muscular endurance in the quadriceps and glutes.

There is also a more upright posture in which the centre of gravity is higher and more closed. This is the position adopted by Paquito Navarro, for example, where the player brings his feet closer together and bends his knees less, increasing mobility but decreasing stability. This stance often involves excessive use of the wrist, forearm and lower back to perform negative-negative pole strokes, which can increase the risk of injury.

The third position consists of a greater distance between the legs, with the adductors being the most used muscles, and is used by Fernando Belasteguín, for example. This stance is characterised by greater stability but less mobility, and requires a greater ability to anticipate and read the opponent's movement.

**Body profile**

By definition the body profile is the position that the player takes prior to the technical execution of a shot. It can be more open or more closed, according to the intention he wants to give to the shot.

An open profile has great advantage, as it allows the player to better hide the intention of the shot, having a greater peripheral view of the opponents and the whole field.

When a player presents a closed profile, where the feet are aligned, it causes the player to lose stability, self-induces a dead angle and increases the risk of injury, because the body rotation will be limited associated with the knee and hip. With a close position it is much easier for the opponents to read the play and react to it, because the options for that shot are limited by that position.

We can make a comparison with soccer, when a player makes a pass in a crossed, straight or inverted direction, he tends to adapt a body position for each of them.
At a more advanced level there is the art of deception where the player presents a more neutral position, absorbing more information to then choose the best shot for each situation.

## Racket positioning and grip

Some rackets present two different geometric figures on the handle, a circle and an octagon. The circle is more difficult to identify the handle because it has no edges, while the octagon has edges. The counting of these edges is done clockwise, with the initial bevel corresponding to 1 and so on. By selecting a phase we will have different types of grip positions.
The Eastern grip is defined by placing the base knuckle of the index finger on the third bevel of the racket handle.
The Backhand grip is defined by placing the index finger on the second bevel of the handle.
The Continental grip is defined by placing the base knuckle of the index finger on the first or second bevel of the racket handle.
For a left handed player the counting is done counterclockwise being the Easter Grip on the seventh bevel, the Backhand Grip on the first bevel and the Continental Grip on the eighth bevel.

![[grips.png]]
Fig: Representation of the different grips

-- Imagem com as diferentes pegas, manuseabilidade vs suporte e posicao de gatilho. como segurar a raquete em bloqueio vs flexibilidade

The implementation of the Eastern grip in padel facilitates power and control in the execution of forehand ground shots and lobs on the left side of the body. This advantage arises from the alignment of the racket's face with the ball. However, it is suboptimal for backhand shots due to the closed orientation of the racket's face on the left side. Consequently, players using this grip often will try to adjust the racket for backhand shots, which can potentially result in injuries.

The Backhand grip, as denoted by its name, optimises the execution of backhand shots and lobs on the right side of the player's body. However, it is suboptimal for forehand shots.

The Continental grip, positioned on the second bevel of the octagon-shaped handle, achieves a consistent alignment of the racket face on both sides. This alignment ensures a direct connection between the racket face and the ball. By manipulating the hand angle, we can apply flat, slice, or topspin strokes, imparting varied effects on the ball.

The hand position alongside the racket handle is also important. If we put the hand further up the handle we will have more control and power when blocking the ball. The lower we hold the racket the more handling and flexibility we will have, facilitating aerial and more angled strokes.

To ensure proper hand placement, it is important to release the index finger and thumb while grabbing the racket handle. The racket should be supported solely by the three fingers below, namely the middle finger, ring finger, and little finger. These three fingers serve as stabilisers and provide support to the racket. The index finger and thumb metaphorically represent a trigger when in an open position. This trigger mechanism is crucial for maintaining control over the racket head, as its absence can result in a loss of control.

## Types of movement

Padel is a fast-paced sport that requires players to be able to move quickly and efficiently in all directions. It's a game that necessitates players to maintain a complete 360-degree awareness of the court, as opposed to merely 180 degrees. This means that players need to be aware of their surroundings and be able to move in any direction at any time.

One important thing that players need to do is to be able to read the opponent's shots in order to get into position early or to react quickly to the opponent’s shot. To perceive the court at 360 degrees, players need to develop good footwork and mobility. This means being able to move quickly in all directions and to change direction quickly.

**Frontal Mobility**

This type of movement begins from a neutral position, where the opponent shot compels the player to move towards the ball. The field of movement lies between the player and the net. To execute this effectively, the player need to accelerate promptly, ensuring that the racket face aligns precisely with the imaginary trajectory of the ball. Frontal mobility is instrumental in closing the gap and seizing control of the point.

**Diagonal Movement**

Diagonal movement unfolds when the ball's trajectory deviates on the side walls. This prompts a pivot rotation of the hips and limbs, causing the player’s chest to turn sideways, thus initiating a small diagonal shift. It's a strategic movement used to maintain an optimal position and respond to balls that deflect from the intended path.

**Moving Backwards**

Moving backward involves executing a pivot step and a reaction step. At the outset, the reaction step is relatively wide, creating additional space between the player and the ball. This allows players to handle faster incoming shots. In situations where the ball falls within the player's technical range, smaller adjustment steps toward the back wall might be needed to effectively maintaining control and court coverage.

**Lateral Steps**

Lateral steps are similar from tennis and are characterized by the open-stance position. This technique allows players to keep their atention fixed on the opponent's court while exerting pressure on the opponent's actions. It entails lateral foot movements without crossing, facilitating efficient hip and waist rotation over the ball. Players can use these movements to cover ground quickly, react to angled shots, and create opportunities for offensive shots.

## Impact points

The impact points on ground shots are specific positions where the racket makes contact with the ball during different phases of the shot. The impact point holds considerable influence over the shot's direction, power, and control. In the case of ground shots, a conceptual line is drawn parallel to the player's shoulders, resulting in four distinct impact points.

The initial impact point is located between the player's shoulders. The second impact point aligns with the player's front shoulder. The third impact point is positioned at a distance equivalent to the length of the racket handle in front of the player's body. The fourth impact point occurs when the player's arm is nearly fully extended.

![[impact-point.png]]

Fig: Representation of the four impact points

For aerial shots, we divide the space into four quadrants. Shots are primarily executed in the first quadrant, between the 12 o'clock and 3 o'clock positions. For left-handed players, shots are executed in the fourth quadrant, between the 9 o'clock and 12 o'clock positions.

These impact point locations are subjective and should be adjusted to suit each player's unique anatomy. Furthermore, it should be noted that the same impact point can yield different directions depending on the player's side.

## Terminations

The terminations of movements in Padel shots are crucial for both technique and strategy. Properly executed terminations can make the difference between an effective shot and one that leaves you vulnerable to your opponents.

**Follow-through:** After striking the ball, players should extend their arm and racket towards the target with a smooth, controlled motion. A complete follow-through not only aids in shot accuracy but also allows for a seamless transition into the ready position for the next shot.

**Weight transfer:** Efficient weight transfer is essential in Padel. When terminating a shot, it's important to transfer your body weight onto your front foot (the foot on the same side as your striking hand). This ensures stability and balance after the shot, enabling players to quickly react to the following play.

**Timing and balance:** The timing of your termination, in sync with your shot, is of utmost importance. Balancing your body weight and coordinating the termination with the point of contact ensures better control and accuracy.

**Recovery and court positioning:** Following the shot termination, players should swiftly recover to a neutral and balanced position. This facilitates readiness for the opponent's response and allows for effective court coverage. Maintaining optimal court positioning is fundamental to your overall strategy.

**Shot selection:** The type of termination can vary depending on the shot choice. For example, when executing a lob shot, players may incorporate a higher, more vertical termination to create elevation. In contrast, a smash shot may involve a more downward termination with a focus on power and placement.

**Disguising intentions:** A vital aspect of shot termination in Padel is to disguise your intentions from your opponents. This involves using similar-looking terminations for various shot choices. By doing so, you can keep your adversaries guessing and maintain a tactical advantage.

Shot termination involves elements of technique, strategy and positioning. Adapting to the speed, angle and position of the ball is a critical aspect of finishing and can significantly improve a player's performance on court.

# Understanding the field
## Field tactical zones (defensive zone, transition zone, offensive zone)

The defence zone in padel is divided into three distinct areas: the green zone, the yellow zone, and the red zone. These zones, also referred to as positional defence, are determined by specific court boundaries.

**Green Zone:** The green zone is the first section of the defence area, starting from the midpoint of the first sector of the fence and extending to the midpoint of the first side glass. In this zone, players experience a sense of comfort and safety and have a high level of control over their opponent's actions. It offers a favourable position for defending and counter-attacking.

**Yellow Zone:** Positioned between the second half of the first side glass and the first half of the second side glass, the yellow zone is considered a neutral zone. Here, the level of danger and comfort depends on the opponent's ability to create pressure and the player's defensive skills. Players need to be alert and adaptable in the yellow zone in order to respond effectively to their opponents.

**Red Zone:** The red zone represents the final metre of the court, comprising the second half of the second side glass. It is the most dangerous zone to defend, as players face a high likelihood of losing the point or compromising their positional defence due to intense pressure from the opponents. In the red zone, players have limited control over the defensive situation, and their shot options are restricted. The primary objective here is to select a shot that facilitates a transition into the yellow or green defensive zones, allowing the player to regain a more advantageous position.

The defensive strategy in padel revolves around effectively navigating these defence zones. Players must be aware of their positioning on the court and adapt their shot selection accordingly to mitigate risk and maintain control during rallies. A well-executed shot from the red zone can facilitate a progressive or immediate transition to safer zones, providing players with an opportunity to regain their defensive composure and strategic advantage.

![[field-positions.png]]

Fig: Representation of the three defence zones, red, yellow and green

The offensive zone is aligned with the same color pattern as the defensive zone but in reverse order. The color scheme directly reflects the player's mindset, offering a clear indication of their potential to secure a point.

**Green Zone:** Within the green zone, players find themselves in a comfort zone. In this phase, the attacker's primary objective is to maintain a strong net position while gradually pressuring the opposing team, driving them deeper into their defensive zone. Here, finishing opportunities are low, as the attacker and defender are evenly matched in terms of positioning and control.

**Yellow Zone:** As we transition to the yellow zone, the attacking player assumes a more offensive stance. This shift enables an increase in their likelihood of successfully finishing the point. The player seizes the opportunity add pressure into the opponent, paving the way for more decisive and potentially point-winning moves.

**Red Zone:** In the red zone, the odds of finishing the point are significantly elevated. In this high-pressure arena, the attacking player has effectively pushed their opponents into the last meter of the court. The high pressure exerted by the attacking team limits the chances of the defending team to effectively defend or counter-attack. This is where the attacking player has the greatest potential to secure the point with a well-executed shot or strategy.

![[ofensive-zone.png]]

Fig: Representation of the three offensive zones, red, yellow and green

Understanding how to navigating between these zones is imperative to achieving success in padel. Players who comprehend the nuances of these zones and can adapt their strategies, choose correctly where to play the ball and keep the pressure on the opponent's team, maximize their chances of winning the point and, ultimately, securing a victory.

## Definition of the Fence

In a Padel court, the fence is structured into three distinct sectors, each sector number correlating with the shot intensity, all while keeping in mind the overarching objective of maintaining net positioning and winning the point. Sector 1 is situated closest to the service line, and to gain or retain the net positioning, players should execute deep shots at speed levels 1 and 2. This strategic approach serves to push the opposing defensive team backward.

As we transition into Sector 2, players can intensify their shots in their to secure the net position, thereby escalating shot intensity to levels 3 or 4. The strategic intent here is to exert greater pressure on the opposition.

Upon entering Sector 3, it signifies a heightened likelihood of employing maximum shot velocity. This strategic choice minimizes the opponent's reaction time and greatly enhances the changes of winning the point.

%%a malha é composta por 3 setores, é e dada por uma nuemrolozada esacial e de interpretacao tecnica a qualquer atlea, o funcamento desta numerologia tem por base a intensidade na qual o jogar podera aplcar na bola sabendo que tem como principal objetivo manter semore que possivel a zona ofensiva. Quanto mais proximo o jogador estiver da linha branca, usando as escalas de velocidade, o jogador deve aplicar velocidades baixas mas com alta profundidade de modo a conquistar a zona ofensiva, velocidades 1 e 2. o Setor 2 signifca que o individo pode aumentar a intensiade da bola entre 3 e 4 para criar pressao na defesa e conquistar a rede. Quando um jogador se encontra dentro do setor 3 da malha, significa que este tem uma grande possibilidade de aplicar uma velocidade maxima estando numa zona de conclusao do ponto, na qual a reacao do adversario é bastante reduzida e existe uma maior facilidade de finalizar o ponto.%%

## Glasses

In Level 1 of Fran's methodology, the definition of glasses is presented in a simplified way, as this is an introductory approach aimed at beginners. In this initial phase, the aim is to simplify the concept of the glasses and make it easier to learn, with the aim of achieving a higher success rate and, consequently, a higher retention rate.

The padel court has a total of 18 glasses, 9 on each side of the court. These can be divided into two groups: the back glass and the side glass.
We call glass 3 the central glass of the back wall; glasses 2 are the glasses next to glass 3 (central glass); glasses 1 are the ones in the corners.
The same designation applies to the side walls, where glasses 1 corresponds to the glasses immediately after the side fence and glasses 2 are the ones connecting to the back wall.

Glasses 2 can be used as building glasses for the attacking team, or as counter-attacking glasses for the defending team. The attacking team must play a ball with an intensity between 1 and 3 (on a scale of 1 to 5), creating a ball with a lower rebound on the glass to ensure the opponent's movement. The defending team can take advantage of a ball with a higher rebound to counter-attack.

Glass 3 is considered a joker glass because it can be used in several different ways. Depending on the intensity and effect that the player applies to the ball, it can be used as a building glass, an offensive glass or a defensive glass. In padel, the glasses must be used strategically, taking into account the different functions assigned to each one, in order to maximise the success of the game.

# Ground Techniques
## How to do the padel serve

In padel, the serve is the first shot of the game and it can be played with a forehand or backhand slice. By definition, the slice is a shot where the racket's face hits the ball in the middle and ends below the ball, it belongs to the downward technical movement patterns, i.e. it starts at the positive pole and ends at the negative pole. This downward movement causes a low bounce when it touches the glass.

An important factor when serving is the position of the feet. For right-handed players, the left foot must be in front of the right foot with a slight bend in the torso, and the elbow is what we call the performance indicator for this technical movement. The higher the elbow, the better the service.

Another important factor is that we want our service to cover as many metres of the opposing team's field as possible, the closer to the line the better. Despite the risk, I think it is important that the first service is seen and received by the first responders as a true first service, where there is effectively a visible distinction from the second service.

The serve can also be executed with a backhand slice, within the same family of descending patterns. A right-handed player will find it easier to serve from the left side to the left side because he has more angle to hit the serve. Like some top players like Paquito Navarro, who is perhaps the greatest technical example of this type of execution. It's a weapon that should always be taken into account. Don't think that the service always has to be served with a forehand slice, the backhand slice is also an option and it is not and should not be seen as an offence against the opponent, but rather as an advantage for the server.

## Return the service

The service is a key moment in the game as it will trigger a response from the opponent, which can be defensive or offensive. The first service is usually a service designed to put pressure on the opposing team, forcing them to play a defensive shot.

In the service response phase, it is important for the player to adopt a tactical position that defines the defensive base. There are three different positions that can be adopted in response to the service, the choice of which depends on each player's physique, physical ability and style of play:
- The most common option is to position the defending player at the intersection between back glass 1 and 2 and at the intersection between side glass 1 and 2;
- Another option is to place the player on the white line and take a step back so that they are aligned with the intersection between glass 1 and glass 2 at the back;
- Finally, the player can position himself between the separation of back glass 1 and 2, with his dominant arm extended sideways towards side glass 1 and 2. This position will result in a greater distance between the player and the T-zone.

Another factor to consider when responding to a service is the trajectory of the service. If it's a service towards the T-zone, the responding player has a wider area to return the ball to, making it easier to execute.

When serving to the side glass, it's important for the defending player to leave some space between himself and the glass in order to hit the ball after it hits the glass. In this case, the player can take a more preventative stance, anticipating that the ball will hit the glass.

As far as the direction of the response is concerned, it should preferably be towards the player who served, because the player will be moving towards the net and will therefore have less time to prepare for a full attack.

The second service is usually a service that makes it easier for the defending pair to respond. The defending pair may choose to play a lob and try to gain control of the net.

## Forehand

In general, the forehand is one of the first shots that most of the players try because t's a natural motion of the arm and executed on the same side as the player's dominant hand. It's important to improve it with the correct technique, since it's one of the most used shots. Let's break down the process into distinct stages for better understanding and execution.

As the ball approaches, it's important to position ourselves correctly. Adopt an open stance with the knees bent and the body slightly inclined towards the ball. During the preparation, maintain the dominant hand's elbow proximate to the body while forming a 90-degree angle, resembling an L shape. We should always try to hit the ball between our shoulders. After making contact, continue the swing fluidly, extending the racket tip in the direction we want the ball to go. A smooth and complete follow-through ensures improved control and balance in our shot.

By providing a comprehensive explanation of the technical steps involved in the forehand shot, the player can better comprehend and analyse the information. However, it is important to acknowledge that translating theoretical knowledge into practical application on the padel court can pose challenges for inexperienced players. In addition to the general technical guidance, it's important to focus on individualised technical analysis, recognising and addressing the most common mistakes made by each player. This observation should be tailored to the specific needs and characteristics of each individual. Every player is unique, with their own history and requirements, thus necessitating a personalised approach.

## Backhand

The backhand is a shot executed on the non-dominant side of the body and usually requires a high motor coordination when compared with the forehand. Normally, an amateur player feels more confident hitting a forehand shot than backhand, so they avoid hitting it. There are several factors that contribute to this problem, such as a lack of coordination or strength.

The technique is similar to the forehand; we should adopt an open stance, with our knees bent and the weight evenly distributed on both feet. Again, it's important to position ourselves correctly with our dominant shoulder pointing towards the target. Hold the racket with both hands, with your non-dominant hand providing support and stability and the tip of the racket pointing to the back wall. Rotate your shoulders and hips towards the target, transferring the body weight from the back foot to the front foot. Extend the arm, leading with the elbow, and aim to make contact with the ball between our shoulders. After making contact with the ball it's crucial to release our non-dominant hand backwards to keep balance and follow-through with the racket tip into the direction of the target.

To complement the technical explanation, we should break it into multiple steps and  demonstrate to the players. It's important to correct footwork, body positioning and the grip and adapt it to each player.

## Forehand with back glass

The forehand off-glass is a shot derived from the forehand shot. One of the main differences is that the action zone is not in front of the body but behind the back, so the ball comes from behind.

This requires a different type of mobility, so the glass exit is characterised by starting with a pivot or reaction movement, supported by the rotation of the shoulders, the hips and the the supporting foot, which will be the right one if the player is right-handed or the left one if he is left-handed.

There are a couple of details to keep in mind, the handle of the racket should point towards the opponent and the tip of the racket should point towards the back glass, the position of the racket should not be straight, but slightly inclined, with the face of the racket pointing slightly towards the sky.

## TODO: Backhand with back glass
## Side glasses and double glasses

**Side Glass 1**

The Side Glass 1 is the glass that comes just after the first fence panel. The glass represents the initial construction model of the game, consisting of three shots: the service, the response to the service, and the first volley.

In this model there are also other variations, in which the service is not made towards the first side glass, but towards the opponent's body or T, the centre line.

When the ball goes to the side glass, it is tricky for players to read the trajectory of the ball, the timing of the shot and the positioning of the shot. That's why the service is usually placed in the side glass to create difficulties for the opponent.

The first side glass has a special feature: unlike the back glass, where our plan of action is from back to front, the side glass comes from the side. So the player has position himself into a semi-open position, i.e. with the supporting foot pointing towards the junction of side glass 2 and back glass 1, the corner, rotate his shoulders, waist and hips so that he can move backwards.

When the ball enters the side glass, it makes a 90º angle and goes towards the centre of the court. Reading the trajectory of the ball is essential for the player to adjust his position and move backwards towards the second back glass.

It's important that the player understands that the movement backwards must be towards the second back glass in order to create space for the ball to be placed between the body and the side glass and to have time to reach the ball, either to hit a forehand shot, if he's playing on the right side, or a backhand shot, if he's playing on the left side.

Two common mistakes when responding to a side ball are to anticipate the ball and prevent it from reaching the side glass, and to move towards the corner or the first side glass instead of the second side glass.

The Continental grip is the most suitable grip for defending this glass, as it allows the racket to hit the ball straight, even though it requires more strength in the forearm and hand.

**Side Glass 2**

The second side glass is a glass often used by the attacking player to ensure that the ball doesn't bounce too much and, above all, that it doesn't have too much exit. The bounce is the height of the ball and the exit is the length of the ball after it has bounced off the glass.

The second side glass is also used when the attacking player wants the defending player to rotate in the corner and get the ball behind his back, and also allows him to use more power when attacking.

There are two ways of defending the second side glass. Let's say the game is played from right to right, so the player on the right is right-handed. There are two ways of defending this situation.

In the first situation, the player moves in the same way as in the first side glass, i.e. in a semi-open position but it moves backwards to the third side glass. The player has to adjust his position in order to place the ball between his shoulders and hit a forehand shoot, depending on whether the ball bounces forward or closer to the glass. This allows the defender to keep his eyes on his opponents, which means he never turns his back on his opponents.

The second situation occurs when the defending player increases the distance to the back glass, usually by defending in a more advanced position close to the service line. In this situation the player is forced to move backwards and rotate so that he hits the ball on his left side. This rotation allows the player to choose one of three possible shots, a backhand shot, a backhand counter glass or a backhand off the glass. One of the disadvantages of this rotation is that the defender doesn't have a clear view of his opponents.

The difference between Side Glass One and Side Glass Two is directly related to the player's initial defensive position. If the ball passes close to the player's right shoulder, it will go to the first side glass. If the ball passes away from the player's right shoulder and away from his body, the ball will go to the second side glass, indicating that the player needs to move away in order to hit a forehand shot or rotate to hit a backhand shot.

## Lob

The Lob is one of the most important shots and it requires a set of conditions for its execution. We can divide the lob into two shots, the fast lob and the high lob.

The high lob is usually executed under these conditions. The player should be into a positional defence and finds themselves pushed to the last meters of the court. It indicates that the opponents are likely maintaining an aggressive and dominant position on the court, specifically in the attacking zones yellow or red (close to the net). By positioning themselves near the net, the opponents create space behind them. Understanding this situation is vital for the defending player and their partner to adjust their position and evaluate the risk of executing a lob to potentially exploit the space behind the opponents.

On a technical level, the high lob is characterised by the player facing the ball with the racket face open in the letter I, while on the left side it presents the letter L. The ball must be placed between the player's belly and the net, the supporting limbs must be in a scissor position with a stable amplitude and the execution requires the coordination between the squatting of the lower limbs accompanied by an uppercut of the arm with the dominant hand to be launched towards the ceiling. The height of the ball is a decisive factor for the balloon which must be between the neutral and negative pole.

The player should face the ball with the face of the racket open, forming the shape of the letter 'I', while the left side of the racket forms the letter 'L' with the body. This grip allows optimal control of the shot. The supporting limbs must be in a scissors position to provide a stable base for the execution of the shot. The amplitude of the scissor stance ensures balance during the preparation and follow through of the shot. We should aim to place the ball between the abdomen and the net. This specific positioning helps to achieve the desired impact for the lob. The successful execution of the high lob requires a coordinated movement between the upper and lower limbs. The player squats with the lower limbs and simultaneously makes an uppercut movement with the dominant hand, driving the ball towards the ceiling. The height of the ball is a decisive factor for the lob, which must be between the neutral and negative pole.

To execute a high lob with the back glass, the player's body should be positioned perpendicular to the back glass and the face of the racket should be opened and forming the shape of the letter 'I' in order to hit the ball on 6 o'clock, underneath the ball. Like the high lob without the glass all the other conditions should be verified, the position of the opponent team and the height of the ball.

It's important that the player performing the high lob is aware that the ball must reach the maximum height in his court in order for the ball to stay in the court.

The fast lob is an important shot when the opposing team has a high attacking capacity. It can be described as a fast and offensive shot that prevents the opponent from making a skilled technical move that requires fast shots. In order to execute this shot, we must take into account that the rebound of the ball must be between the negative pole and the neutral pole, or from a low speed volley that does not cross the white line. We must release the arm in a rising trajectory to hit the ball, ending slightly in front of the forehead.

## Volleys

The volley in padel is primarily an offensive shot, strategically executed in the forward area of the court to apply pressure on opponents, thereby restricting their defensive and counter-attacking options. For precise volley analysis, we categorise the volley zones into three distinct poles, spanning both left and right sides.

The **Positive pole** extends from the head to the waist, while the **Neutral pole** spans from the waist to the knee. Lastly, the **Negative pole** is delineated from the knee to the calf.

From a technical standpoint, the general volley technique on the right side involves preparation with the elbow raised, forming a 90-degree angle between the forearm/arm and the body, and holding the racket face open with the tip directed upwards. During execution, the objective is to strike the ball in front of oneself at an angle of approximately 135 degrees relative to the body. For the termination phase, the arm extends nearly to full length, creating an angle close to 180 degrees with the body.

In the case of the Negative pole, maintaining balance and control is essential, necessitating proximity of the elbow to the body during ball contact.

Manipulating the racket angle during ball contact determines the type of effect applied to the volley shot.

For a **Flat Volley**, the ball must be struck from above and through its center, directing the arm towards the intended hitting direction. The goal is to minimise any effect or rotation, ensuring a straight trajectory.

In the case of an **Inverted Volley**, the ball is struck in the fourth quadrant, between 9 o'clock and 12 o'clock, with the shot terminating in the second quadrant. This volley involves hitting the ball from the top left and finishing at the bottom right.

For a **Slice Volley**, the ball is hit in the first quadrant, between 12 o'clock and 3 o'clock, with the shot terminating in the third quadrant. The hitting motion entails striking the ball from the top right to the bottom left.

The volley movement pattern can be divided into four phases, adaptable to each player's morphology. The first phase involves preparation, where the hips and shoulders rotate into an open stance while holding the racket up. The second phase is the impact on the ball. The third phase signifies the termination of the impact movement and determines the shot's direction. The fourth phase encompasses the movement of the hips and shoulders into a ready position to read the opponent's shot and respond accordingly.

### Volleys on left side

On the left side, the volley preparation entails replicating the motion from the sleep position. The elbow should be oriented slightly forward, while the forearm/arm assumes an L shape at a 45-degree angle relative to the body.

On to the **Positive** and **Neutral** poles for a **Flat Volley**, the movement progression continues in a descending vertical manner. For an **Inverted Volley**, the ball is struck from quadrant one to three, while a **Slice Volley** involves hitting the ball from quadrant four to two.

The direction of the volley is primarily governed by the rotation of the shoulders, taking into consideration the predetermined contact points as defined previously.

## Block Volley

The block volley consists of a defensive movement in relation to the opponent's increase in speed. The amplitude of our movement is inversely proportional to the speed of the opponent's shot. To perform this shot, the player must have a stable base, with the feet at shoulder width, hold the racket in the heart to improve stability and lean slightly forward. In order to choose a forehand or backhand volley to block the shot, the player must take into account the anatomy and movements of the body. So all balls from the left shoulder to the right shoulder should be played with a backhand volley and all balls after the right shoulder with a forehand volley. This pattern is reversed for left-handed players.

## Volley to the fence

The volley to the fence depends on which side of the court the player is on and which fence he is aiming at, parallel or crosscourt. If the player is playing on the right side, the crosscourt volley requires the impact point to be in front of the body, the racket face to hit the ball on the right side (outside in) and a rotation of the hips and shoulders after contact with the ball. If the player is positioned closer to the center of the court and aiming to the parallel fence, then it will play a backhand volley in front of the body, followed by a slight rotation of the shoulders and hips. If the right side player wants to play a forehand volley to the parallel fence it should apply a inside in effect and rotate to the side side. This pattern is reversed for left side players.

Volleying at the fence is a risky shot because the bounce is unpredictable and can lead to counter-attacking situations if the bounce is too high, or to winning the point with the bounce.

## Slice

The slice, also known as the cutting effect, is a technical movement characterised by the fact that the face of the racket hits the ball in the center and, right after the impact with the ball, there is a twist in the wrist and arm at 6 o'clock in order to cause a certain fluctuation of the ball due to the effect applied, where there is no great index of power applied. The preparation for the slice requires the ball to be placed between 2 o'clock and 3 o'clock, the elbow to be well above the shoulder and the technique to be completed with full chest extension.

The main purpose of the slice is to give depth to the shot. To do this, the player must realise that the opponent needs to be positioned between the service line and the back glass and the closer the ball hits the glass, the better, because the less the ball will bounce and the harder it will be to defend.

## Side spin

By definition, a side spin is a technical movement where the racket face hits the ball from the centre and at the moment of impact there is a rotation of the forearm and wrist around 1 o'clock and 2 o'clock. The ball must be placed between 1 and 2 o'clock and the player should take a "bow and arrow" stance. The purpose of the side spin, as opposed to the slice, is to hit a ball full of spin and power in front of the opponent, making it more difficult to read its trajectory.

# Overhead Techniques
## Bandeja

It is crucial to dispel the misconception that the "Bandeja" shot initiation must resemble a waitress carrying a tray. Presently, the bandeja is executed with a preference for a flat stroke on the ball as opposed to a slice shot. The shot consists of approximately 60% flat stroke and 40% slice stroke.

Metaphorically, in this shot, the attacker holds a positional advantage over the opponent, enabling the ball to be struck from a vantage point. This advantageous position is contrasted with the opponent team's defensive stance in a ready position to defend. Exploiting this vantage point, the shot's preparation should not be overly telegraphed, allowing for an element of surprise. Consequently, the direction and power of the shot can be strategically chosen based on the opponents' positions.

The preparatory stance somewhat resembles a volley with a high elbow and an arm amplitude that does not extend beyond the back line.

The impact axis, pictured perpendicular to our body and extending from the legs to the head, follows a clock movement, commencing at 12 o'clock. To optimise impact on the ball, it is ideal for the contact to occur between 2 o'clock and 3 o'clock. Moreover, the angle at which the racket's face strikes the ball should be centred within the first and third quadrants. For the termination phase, the contact point should fall slightly below the left side of the lower chest. The orientation of the point of impact is determined by the clockwise direction, represented on the y-axis, particularly in quadrant 1.

As a player, it is imperative to adapt a Backhand grip to effectively execute a slice shot in the first quadrant. The rationale behind this approach lies in ensuring that the impact point remains within the security threshold and does not exceed the 3 o'clock mark or drop below it. This is because any impact below this threshold divulges substantial information to the opponent about our shot possibilities, compromising the efficiency of our bandeja shot. Additionally, striking the ball below this threshold may result in the ball floating in the air, leading to potential ball-out scenarios or presenting the opponents with counter-attacking opportunities. On the other hand, by hitting the ball within our security threshold, we gain a broader spectrum of directions and power that we can strategically choose based on the opponent's positional pressure. Notably, the position of the racket face significantly influences the desired direction of the shot.

Typically, the bandeja shot arises as a counter to an opponent's lob shot, inducing a seamless transition from an offensive stance to a defensive one with a regressive motion to hit the ball and quickly get back to a stable position for the next shot.

Firstly, we start the movement by rotating the lower support limb, the right leg, while slightly bending the knees and lifting the glutes. At the same time, the upper body leans forward slightly. This position is similar to the ready position, but facing the side wall. As the ball rises to its peak height, we initiate the initial displacement by performing crossed steps.

During this phase, our objective is to maximise stability. Therefore, as the ball begins its downward trajectory, we perform lateral steps as adjustment steps to create a solid and balanced foundation. Before executing the shot, it is important to separate the lower limbs beyond shoulder width to achieve an optimal base and facilitate efficient weight transfer onto the ball. Our aim is to place the ball on our right side, between our shoulders, in the first quadrant. We can imitate this movement by imagining that we are lifting a box to catch the ball. This will give us a good point of reference for the distance of the shot with the ball.

On impact, the trajectory of the body should be aligned with the intended direction of the shot, facilitating precision and control over the movement of the ball. With a stable position and a good transfer of weight to the shot, we can quickly get back into a good position to deal with the next shot.

## Vibora

The "Vibora" is a shot usually used in 3 aspects, offensive, maintaining the position or recovery.

The attacking Vibora is characterised when the player has a stable position and is able to perform a comfortable weight transfer on the ball, in which the increase in ball speed can be 4 or 5, and will move quickly to the new position he wants to conquer. The factor that will define the vibora as recovery or acceleration will be the stability of the player's base before impact. The more stable the player is before hitting the ball, the faster he will be able to move to the new position.

The maintenance vibora is defined by an unstable position that requires the player to reduce the speed of the shot in order to regain the tactical position for the next shot.

The recovery vibora is characterised by a lack of stability, typically with the body leaning backwards. This creates a total imbalance in the technical execution of the shot. This instability can be easily recognised by the opponent, who reacts to the hit by moving closer to the net in order to counter the shot. In this situation, the vibora shot is executed with the lower arm and the wrist, with the coordination of an eccentric force, and the player is forced to regain the game in the defensive zone.

The Vibora shot is characterised by the rotational aspect it incorporates, achieved by striking the ball in the first quadrant and finishing the shot in the fourth quadrant, resembling a brushing movement through the ball. From a technical point of view, the point of contact is in the first quadrant, between 1 o'clock and 2 o'clock, resulting in a higher point of impact than the bandeja shot.

To prepare for the Vibora shot, the player assumes a stance similar to a military salute, with the face of the racket facing the ground and the tip of the racket facing the opponent's court. The elbow is high and forms an angle of more than 90 degrees with the body, while the forearm forms an angle of 45 degrees with the arm.

During the follow through, the movement ends slightly higher than the left shoulder, allowing a controlled and dynamic execution of the shot. The rotational nature of the Vibora shot allows players to apply spin and precision, adding versatility to their offensive shots on the court.

## Smash
### Flat (Winter or Bomba)

The "Fast Smash", also known as the "Winter Smash" or "Bomba", is a high speed shot in padel. The execution of this shot requires a well-structured technique to maximise its effectiveness.

In order to execute the Fast Smash, players should adopt a "bow and arrow" stance, where the racket is pulled back, much like the string of a bow. The positioning of the ball is crucial, ideally at or around forehead level and must be hit in front of the body. Once the ball is struck, the follow-through movement of the racquet simulates the action of hurling an axe, generating considerable power and speed.

This shot is most strategically used when facing a high lob from the opponent. The aim is to catch the opponent off guard while they are repositioning themselves. The Fast Smash is designed to deliver a quick and surprising ball, limiting the opponent's reaction time and potentially resulting in a winning shot.

### Lifted (By 3 - side wall)

Like the "Vibora" shot, the "Lifted Smash" has the military salute preparation, which should start when the ball starts to deflect A very common mistake is that the player is already prepared, but the ball hasn't reached the maximum height of the parabola of its trajectory, which causes him to lose the fluidity of his biomechanics, performing the shot in 2 steps, preparing to salute and hitting the ball.

The smash shot, also known as the smash by 3, is a technically demanding shot in padel, as it necessitates excellent coordination between the lower and upper limbs, precise spatial awareness, and timing of execution. The technical pattern for executing a successful smash shot involves the following key points:

Anticipation is crucial in preparing for the smash shot. The player needs to read the opponent's shot and move quickly to position themselves correctly under the descending ball. Proper footwork is essential to get into the ideal hitting position.

As the ball descends, the player needs to align their body to position the ball in the first quadrant between 12 o'clock and 2 o'clock ( for left-handed players it should be between 11 o'clock and 12 o'clock). The non-hitting arm should be extended for balance and to provide stability during the shot, pointing to the glass 1 or 2 in order to allow the correct rotation of the hips and the right arm on the ball. The player should hit the ball at the highest point possible, just before it starts to drop significantly. Making clean and accurate contact with the ball is essential for a successful smash. The face of the racket should go through the ball from 12 o'clock to 3 o'clock, brushing the ball.

In the initial phase of the movement the lower limbs are at shoulder width and just before executing the two feet are brought together to lift the body towards the ball. A well-executed smash shot requires a quick and explosive transfer of weight from the back foot to the front foot. This weight transfer adds power to the shot.

After hitting the ball, the follow-through should extend fully to complete the shot's motion.

The most common mistake in this technique is represented when the player tries to hit the ball between 11 and 12, when the correct position should be between 12 and 2. The player ends up creating an optical illusion through the inclination of the body, visually enhancing the ball in the correct sector.

Players tend to confuse power with fluidity. The technical movements are based on the player's ability to execute a high intensity shot in a short space of time, enhanced by the ability to transfer weight from the lower limbs to the shot. This movement is called dynamic balance. Most athletes tend to generate a stiffness in the limbs and the imbalance is represented by a robotic dynamic that prevents the player from transferring all his strength to the ball.

### By 4 (back wall)

The "Smash by 4" is a shot recognised for its pivotal role as the end result of a well-executed, strategic offensive manoeuvre by the attacking team. This shot is typically used as a point-closing shot, executed in Sector 3 of the court.

The defining characteristic of the Smash by 4 is the precise bending of the wrist along the vertical axis. This intricate wrist movement is instrumental in sending the ball towards the back wall, leaving the opponent no chance to react. It is a highly technical and finesse shot that, if executed with precision, can win a point for the attacking team.

## Ball to the fence (Rulo)

The "Ball to fence" or "Rulo", is a direct continuation of the "Lifted Smash" and its preparation is similar to the "Winter Smash" adopting the "bow and arrow" preparation.

The special feature of the "Ball to the fence" is the player's adaptation to the opponent's lob, which demands an arching of the back in order to hit the ball. The speed of the ball must be carefully managed, with the player's visual assessment of the opponent's positioning being the key factor.

The speed of execution falls into two categories: slow, marked 2 and 3, or fast, marked 4 and 5. The choice between these speeds depends on the position of the opponent. If the opponent is close to the white line and leaning towards the side glass, indicating a preference for letting the ball bounce rather than attempting a block, the optimal approach is to play the ball at the union of the glass and the fence, making it difficult to defend.

Conversely, if the opponent positions himself closer to the net, indicating an intention to block the ball, the player should hit a fast ball, making it difficult for the opponent to successfully block or time his defensive move. The execution of the fence ball exemplifies the strategic nuances of padel, driven by dynamic responses to the opponent's position and intentions on the court.
