## How to do the padel serve

In padel, the serve is the first shot of the game and it can be played with a forehand or backhand slice. By definition, the slice is a shot where the racket's face hits the ball in the middle and ends below the ball, it belongs to the downward technical movement patterns, i.e. it starts at the positive pole and ends at the negative pole. This downward movement causes a low bounce when it touches the glass.

An important factor when serving is the position of the feet. For right-handed players, the left foot must be in front of the right foot with a slight bend in the torso, and the elbow is what we call the performance indicator for this technical movement. The higher the elbow, the better the service.

Another important factor is that we want our service to cover as many metres of the opposing team's field as possible, the closer to the line the better. Despite the risk, I think it is important that the first service is seen and received by the first responders as a true first service, where there is effectively a visible distinction from the second service.

The serve can also be executed with a backhand slice, within the same family of descending patterns. A right-handed player will find it easier to serve from the left side to the left side because he has more angle to hit the serve. Like some top players like Paquito Navarro, who is perhaps the greatest technical example of this type of execution. It's a weapon that should always be taken into account. Don't think that the service always has to be served with a forehand slice, the backhand slice is also an option and it is not and should not be seen as an offence against the opponent, but rather as an advantage for the server.

## Return the service

The service is a key moment in the game as it will trigger a response from the opponent, which can be defensive or offensive. The first service is usually a service designed to put pressure on the opposing team, forcing them to play a defensive shot.

In the service response phase, it is important for the player to adopt a tactical position that defines the defensive base. There are three different positions that can be adopted in response to the service, the choice of which depends on each player's physique, physical ability and style of play:
- The most common option is to position the defending player at the intersection between back glass 1 and 2 and at the intersection between side glass 1 and 2;
- Another option is to place the player on the white line and take a step back so that they are aligned with the intersection between glass 1 and glass 2 at the back;
- Finally, the player can position himself between the separation of back glass 1 and 2, with his dominant arm extended sideways towards side glass 1 and 2. This position will result in a greater distance between the player and the T-zone.

Another factor to consider when responding to a service is the trajectory of the service. If it's a service towards the T-zone, the responding player has a wider area to return the ball to, making it easier to execute.

When serving to the side glass, it's important for the defending player to leave some space between himself and the glass in order to hit the ball after it hits the glass. In this case, the player can take a more preventative stance, anticipating that the ball will hit the glass.

As far as the direction of the response is concerned, it should preferably be towards the player who served, because the player will be moving towards the net and will therefore have less time to prepare for a full attack.

The second service is usually a service that makes it easier for the defending pair to respond. The defending pair may choose to play a lob and try to gain control of the net.

## Forehand

In general, the forehand is one of the first shots that most of the players try because t's a natural motion of the arm and executed on the same side as the player's dominant hand. It's important to improve it with the correct technique, since it's one of the most used shots. Let's break down the process into distinct stages for better understanding and execution.

As the ball approaches, it's important to position ourselves correctly. Adopt an open stance with the knees bent and the body slightly inclined towards the ball. During the preparation, maintain the dominant hand's elbow proximate to the body while forming a 90-degree angle, resembling an L shape. We should always try to hit the ball between our shoulders. After making contact, continue the swing fluidly, extending the racket tip in the direction we want the ball to go. A smooth and complete follow-through ensures improved control and balance in our shot.

By providing a comprehensive explanation of the technical steps involved in the forehand shot, the player can better comprehend and analyse the information. However, it is important to acknowledge that translating theoretical knowledge into practical application on the padel court can pose challenges for inexperienced players. In addition to the general technical guidance, it's important to focus on individualised technical analysis, recognising and addressing the most common mistakes made by each player. This observation should be tailored to the specific needs and characteristics of each individual. Every player is unique, with their own history and requirements, thus necessitating a personalised approach.

## Backhand

The backhand is a shot executed on the non-dominant side of the body and usually requires a high motor coordination when compared with the forehand. Normally, an amateur player feels more confident hitting a forehand shot than backhand, so they avoid hitting it. There are several factors that contribute to this problem, such as a lack of coordination or strength.

The technique is similar to the forehand; we should adopt an open stance, with our knees bent and the weight evenly distributed on both feet. Again, it's important to position ourselves correctly with our dominant shoulder pointing towards the target. Hold the racket with both hands, with your non-dominant hand providing support and stability and the tip of the racket pointing to the back wall. Rotate your shoulders and hips towards the target, transferring the body weight from the back foot to the front foot. Extend the arm, leading with the elbow, and aim to make contact with the ball between our shoulders. After making contact with the ball it's crucial to release our non-dominant hand backwards to keep balance and follow-through with the racket tip into the direction of the target.

To complement the technical explanation, we should break it into multiple steps and  demonstrate to the players. It's important to correct footwork, body positioning and the grip and adapt it to each player.

## Forehand with back glass

The forehand off-glass is a shot derived from the forehand shot. One of the main differences is that the action zone is not in front of the body but behind the back, so the ball comes from behind.

This requires a different type of mobility, so the glass exit is characterised by starting with a pivot or reaction movement, supported by the rotation of the shoulders, the hips and the the supporting foot, which will be the right one if the player is right-handed or the left one if he is left-handed.

There are a couple of details to keep in mind, the handle of the racket should point towards the opponent and the tip of the racket should point towards the back glass, the position of the racket should not be straight, but slightly inclined, with the face of the racket pointing slightly towards the sky.

## Side and Double Glass

<strong>Side Glass 1</strong>

The Side Glass 1 is the glass that comes just after the first fence panel. The glass represents the initial construction model of the game, consisting of three shots: the service, the response to the service, and the first volley.

In this model there are also other variations, in which the service is not made towards the first side glass, but towards the opponent's body or T, the centre line.

When the ball goes to the side glass, it is tricky for players to read the trajectory of the ball, the timing of the shot and the positioning of the shot. That's why the service is usually placed in the side glass to create difficulties for the opponent.

The first side glass has a special feature: unlike the back glass, where our plan of action is from back to front, the side glass comes from the side. So the player has position himself into a semi-open position, i.e. with the supporting foot pointing towards the junction of side glass 2 and back glass 1, the corner, rotate his shoulders, waist and hips so that he can move backwards.

When the ball enters the side glass, it makes a 90ยบ angle and goes towards the centre of the court. Reading the trajectory of the ball is essential for the player to adjust his position and move backwards towards the second back glass.

It's important that the player understands that the movement backwards must be towards the second back glass in order to create space for the ball to be placed between the body and the side glass and to have time to reach the ball, either to hit a forehand shot, if he's playing on the right side, or a backhand shot, if he's playing on the left side.

Two common mistakes when responding to a side ball are to anticipate the ball and prevent it from reaching the side glass, and to move towards the corner or the first side glass instead of the second side glass.

The Continental grip is the most suitable grip for defending this glass, as it allows the racket to hit the ball straight, even though it requires more strength in the forearm and hand.

<strong>Side Glass 2</strong>

The second side glass is a glass often used by the attacking player to ensure that the ball doesn't bounce too much and, above all, that it doesn't have too much exit. The bounce is the height of the ball and the exit is the length of the ball after it has bounced off the glass.

The second side glass is also used when the attacking player wants the defending player to rotate in the corner and get the ball behind his back, and also allows him to use more power when attacking.

There are two ways of defending the second side glass. Let's say the game is played from right to right, so the player on the right is right-handed. There are two ways of defending this situation.

In the first situation, the player moves in the same way as in the first side glass, i.e. in a semi-open position but it moves backwards to the third side glass. The player has to adjust his position in order to place the ball between his shoulders and hit a forehand shoot, depending on whether the ball bounces forward or closer to the glass. This allows the defender to keep his eyes on his opponents, which means he never turns his back on his opponents.

The second situation occurs when the defending player increases the distance to the back glass, usually by defending in a more advanced position close to the service line. In this situation the player is forced to move backwards and rotate so that he hits the ball on his left side. This rotation allows the player to choose one of three possible shots, a backhand shot, a backhand counter glass or a backhand off the glass. One of the disadvantages of this rotation is that the defender doesn't have a clear view of his opponents.

The difference between Side Glass One and Side Glass Two is directly related to the player's initial defensive position. If the ball passes close to the player's right shoulder, it will go to the first side glass. If the ball passes away from the player's right shoulder and away from his body, the ball will go to the second side glass, indicating that the player needs to move away in order to hit a forehand shot or rotate to hit a backhand shot.

## Lob

The Lob is one of the most important shots and it requires a set of conditions for its execution. We can divide the lob into two shots, the fast lob and the high lob.

The high lob is usually executed under these conditions. The player should be into a positional defence and finds themselves pushed to the last meters of the court. It indicates that the opponents are likely maintaining an aggressive and dominant position on the court, specifically in the attacking zones yellow or red (close to the net). By positioning themselves near the net, the opponents create space behind them. Understanding this situation is vital for the defending player and their partner to adjust their position and evaluate the risk of executing a lob to potentially exploit the space behind the opponents.

On a technical level, the high lob is characterised by the player facing the ball with the racket face open in the letter I, while on the left side it presents the letter L. The ball must be placed between the player's belly and the net, the supporting limbs must be in a scissor position with a stable amplitude and the execution requires the coordination between the squatting of the lower limbs accompanied by an uppercut of the arm with the dominant hand to be launched towards the ceiling. The height of the ball is a decisive factor for the balloon which must be between the neutral and negative pole.

The player should face the ball with the face of the racket open, forming the shape of the letter 'I', while the left side of the racket forms the letter 'L' with the body. This grip allows optimal control of the shot. The supporting limbs must be in a scissors position to provide a stable base for the execution of the shot. The amplitude of the scissor stance ensures balance during the preparation and follow through of the shot. We should aim to place the ball between the abdomen and the net. This specific positioning helps to achieve the desired impact for the lob. The successful execution of the high lob requires a coordinated movement between the upper and lower limbs. The player squats with the lower limbs and simultaneously makes an uppercut movement with the dominant hand, driving the ball towards the ceiling. The height of the ball is a decisive factor for the lob, which must be between the neutral and negative pole.

To execute a high lob with the back glass, the player's body should be positioned perpendicular to the back glass and the face of the racket should be opened and forming the shape of the letter 'I' in order to hit the ball on 6 o'clock, underneath the ball. Like the high lob without the glass all the other conditions should be verified, the position of the opponent team and the height of the ball.

It's important that the player performing the high lob is aware that the ball must reach the maximum height in his court in order for the ball to stay in the court.

The fast lob is an important shot when the opposing team has a high attacking capacity. It can be described as a fast and offensive shot that prevents the opponent from making a skilled technical move that requires fast shots. In order to execute this shot, we must take into account that the rebound of the ball must be between the negative pole and the neutral pole, or from a low speed volley that does not cross the white line. We must release the arm in a rising trajectory to hit the ball, ending slightly in front of the forehead.

## Volleys

The volley in padel is primarily an offensive shot, strategically executed in the forward area of the court to apply pressure on opponents, thereby restricting their defensive and counter-attacking options. For precise volley analysis, we categorise the volley zones into three distinct poles, spanning both left and right sides.

The **Positive pole** extends from the head to the waist, while the **Neutral pole** spans from the waist to the knee. Lastly, the **Negative pole** is delineated from the knee to the calf.

From a technical standpoint, the general volley technique on the right side involves preparation with the elbow raised, forming a 90-degree angle between the forearm/arm and the body, and holding the racket face open with the tip directed upwards. During execution, the objective is to strike the ball in front of oneself at an angle of approximately 135 degrees relative to the body. For the termination phase, the arm extends nearly to full length, creating an angle close to 180 degrees with the body.

In the case of the Negative pole, maintaining balance and control is essential, necessitating proximity of the elbow to the body during ball contact.

Manipulating the racket angle during ball contact determines the type of effect applied to the volley shot.

For a **Flat Volley**, the ball must be struck from above and through its center, directing the arm towards the intended hitting direction. The goal is to minimise any effect or rotation, ensuring a straight trajectory.

In the case of an **Inverted Volley**, the ball is struck in the fourth quadrant, between 9 o'clock and 12 o'clock, with the shot terminating in the second quadrant. This volley involves hitting the ball from the top left and finishing at the bottom right.

For a **Slice Volley**, the ball is hit in the first quadrant, between 12 o'clock and 3 o'clock, with the shot terminating in the third quadrant. The hitting motion entails striking the ball from the top right to the bottom left.

The volley movement pattern can be divided into four phases, adaptable to each player's morphology. The first phase involves preparation, where the hips and shoulders rotate into an open stance while holding the racket up. The second phase is the impact on the ball. The third phase signifies the termination of the impact movement and determines the shot's direction. The fourth phase encompasses the movement of the hips and shoulders into a ready position to read the opponent's shot and respond accordingly.

### Volleys on left side

On the left side, the volley preparation entails replicating the motion from the sleep position. The elbow should be oriented slightly forward, while the forearm/arm assumes an L shape at a 45-degree angle relative to the body.

On to the **Positive** and **Neutral** poles for a **Flat Volley**, the movement progression continues in a descending vertical manner. For an **Inverted Volley**, the ball is struck from quadrant one to three, while a **Slice Volley** involves hitting the ball from quadrant four to two.

The direction of the volley is primarily governed by the rotation of the shoulders, taking into consideration the predetermined contact points as defined previously.

## Block Volley

The block volley consists of a defensive movement in relation to the opponent's increase in speed. The amplitude of our movement is inversely proportional to the speed of the opponent's shot. To perform this shot, the player must have a stable base, with the feet at shoulder width, hold the racket in the heart to improve stability and lean slightly forward. In order to choose a forehand or backhand volley to block the shot, the player must take into account the anatomy and movements of the body. So all balls from the left shoulder to the right shoulder should be played with a backhand volley and all balls after the right shoulder with a forehand volley. This pattern is reversed for left-handed players.

## Volley to the fence

The volley to the fence depends on which side of the court the player is on and which fence he is aiming at, parallel or crosscourt. If the player is playing on the right side, the crosscourt volley requires the impact point to be in front of the body, the racket face to hit the ball on the right side (outside in) and a rotation of the hips and shoulders after contact with the ball. If the player is positioned closer to the center of the court and aiming to the parallel fence, then it will play a backhand volley in front of the body, followed by a slight rotation of the shoulders and hips. If the right side player wants to play a forehand volley to the parallel fence it should apply a inside in effect and rotate to the side side. This pattern is reversed for left side players.

Volleying at the fence is a risky shot because the bounce is unpredictable and can lead to counter-attacking situations if the bounce is too high, or to winning the point with the bounce.

## Slice

The slice, also known as the cutting effect, is a technical movement characterised by the fact that the face of the racket hits the ball in the center and, right after the impact with the ball, there is a twist in the wrist and arm at 6 o'clock in order to cause a certain fluctuation of the ball due to the effect applied, where there is no great index of power applied. The preparation for the slice requires the ball to be placed between 2 o'clock and 3 o'clock, the elbow to be well above the shoulder and the technique to be completed with full chest extension.

The main purpose of the slice is to give depth to the shot. To do this, the player must realise that the opponent needs to be positioned between the service line and the back glass and the closer the ball hits the glass, the better, because the less the ball will bounce and the harder it will be to defend.

## Side spin

By definition, a side spin is a technical movement where the racket face hits the ball from the centre and at the moment of impact there is a rotation of the forearm and wrist around 1 o'clock and 2 o'clock. The ball must be placed between 1 and 2 o'clock and the player should take a "bow and arrow" stance. The purpose of the side spin, as opposed to the slice, is to hit a ball full of spin and power in front of the opponent, making it more difficult to read its trajectory.
