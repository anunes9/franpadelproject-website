# Coaching Aspects

## Types of Feedback

While technique and strategy are crucial, feedback is an essential tool in coaching, and it can be delivered in various forms. It is important for a coach to be adaptable and use a combination of feedback types to effectively support their students' learning and skill development. In padel coaching, we will explore the four main types of feedback: visual, auditory, tactile, and kinesthetic (also known as kinaesthetic). The art of coaching lies in the ability to use these different types of feedback effectively. No two players are the same, and what works wonders for one may not be as impactful for another. A skilled tennis coach understands the various learning styles and preferences of their students and adapts their feedback accordingly, ensuring that each player can reach their full potential.
### Visual Feedback

Visual feedback is provided through what the player can see. It can effectively demonstrate proper body positioning, stroke mechanics, and court positioning. This type of feedback is especially helpful for visual learners who learn best by observing and understanding the intricacies of their actions and their relationship to the desired outcome. To optimize the advantages of visual feedback, coaches often utilize slow-motion footage or side-by-side comparisons to highlight the disparities between a player's execution and the ideal technique.
### Auditory Feedback

Auditory feedback is delivered through sound. This type of feedback can include verbal instructions or cues from the coach. For example, the coach might provide instructions on the timing of a swing, positional corrections, type of stroke to play or offer encouragement through words of motivation.

This type of feedback is especially useful for players who respond well to spoken guidance and who benefit from a coach's verbal presence. These individuals often find that the coach's words help them stay focused, motivated, and oriented during practice and matches.
### Tactile Feedback

Tactile feedback involves physical touch or contact. In padel, this could involve the coach making slight adjustments to a player's grip, posture, or stance by physically guiding them. It's a hands-on approach that can help the player feel the correct movements and positions.

For some players, tactile feedback can be immensely effective, especially when they're struggling with specific aspects of their technique. The physical interaction helps them understand the correct feel and muscle memory required for a particular movement. It's like learning through touch, enabling players to connect what they feel with what they see and hear.
### Kinaesthetic (Knesic) Feedback

Kinaesthetic, or kinesthetic, feedback relates to the body's sensation of movement and position. It involves helping the player develop a "feel" for their body's movements. This type of feedback might involve asking the player how a particular movement feels to them or encouraging them to focus on the sensation of a well-executed shot.

This type of feedback is particularly beneficial for players who are highly in tune with their bodies. They can use this type of feedback to develop a more profound understanding of their physical actions and connect their bodily sensations to specific outcomes on the court. It's about developing a "feel" for their movements.

## Ball throwing techniques

At an amateur level, the padel coach should tailor their training and practice sessions to meet the specific needs and skill levels of the players. Remember, coaching at the amateur level is about fostering a love for the sport, nurturing skills, and creating a positive learning environment. With a patient and understanding approach, the coach can help amateur padel players develop their game and enjoy their journey in the sport.

### When should we throw the ball by the floor?

Training a student without a padel racket in hand as a teaching technique is a valuable method for introducing and familiarising beginners or individuals with specific challenges to the technical aspects of padel without the added complexity of holding a racket.

Students who are new to the sport or lack experience with sports teams can benefit from it as it provides a clear and visual way to understand the technical movements and concepts. It provides a controlled environment where the student can focus solely on understanding and processing various padel variables without the added pressure of hitting the ball.

For students with coordination challenges or poor muscular tone, it helps them develop muscle memory and coordination by repetitively simulating the movements without the added weight and complexity of the racket. For students who are new to padel, it reduces the risk of accidents or injuries that could occur when learning with a racket in hand.

Coaches can closely observe the student's movements during shadow practice and provide immediate feedback on technique, enabling the student to make adjustments and improvements.

As the students progress and become more familiar with the technical aspects, they can gradually transition to incorporating the racket and the ball into their practice sessions.

### When should we throw the ball with the hand?

Throwing the ball with the hand for these players can be an essential technique to help beginner students build confidence and develop the necessary technical skills without the added complexities of footwork and racket handling initially.

For this first approach the coach and the student should be on the same side of the court and near at approximately 4 meters from the net.

By throwing the ball in a controlled and close proximity, the coach can create a positive learning environment where the student focus is solely on hitting the ball successfully. This early sense of achievement boosts the student's confidence and encourages them to continue learning and improving.

For beginners who have no sports background or are uncoordinated, starting with the hand-thrown ball eliminates the complexity of learning footwork and racket techniques all at once. It allows the student to concentrate solely on the contact point and basic swing mechanics.

The feeling of successfully hitting the ball over the net is an important milestone for beginners. This achievement can provide a sense of joy and achievement, motivating them to continue practising and learning. As the student experiences success through hand-throw exercises, they begin to develop a positive mindset, believing in their ability to improve and excel in the sport.

When the student is comfortable throwing the ball and the technical movement associated, the coach can introduce new concepts as ball lecture, footwork and technique. As a progression, the coach goes to the other side of the net and throws ball to the student.

Once the student becomes comfortable with hitting the ball and has gained confidence in the technical movement associated with it, the coach can progress to introduce new concepts and challenges to further develop the player's skills.

To challenge the student further, the coach moves to the opposite side of the net and throws balls to the student. This helps the student practice hitting balls coming from a different direction, simulating real match situations.

Initially, the focus is on the student getting comfortable with hitting the hand-thrown ball and gaining confidence in executing the basic swing mechanics.
Once the student feels more at ease, the coach can introduce new concepts such as ball lecture (the different types of balls received), footwork (movement and positioning on the court), and technique (specific shot mechanics).

As the student progresses, the coach can incorporate game-based drills, where the student practices specific techniques and skills in the context of simulated game scenarios. The coach gradually introduces more complex drills and exercises, encouraging the student to adapt and improve their decision-making skills and shot selection.

Throughout the progression, the coach provides continuous feedback and guidance, helping the student refine their technique, strategy, and overall gameplay.

### When should we throw the ball with the racket?

The progression from hand-thrown balls to using a padel racket introduces a new level of difficulty and complexity to the training process. It is essential for the coach to ensure that the student is ready for this advancement and that they have a solid foundation in fundamental skills. Once the student has demonstrated improved ability to control the ball and has developed a level of proficiency in different technical aspects of padel, the coach can progress to the next stage of training, which involves throwing the ball with the racket.

As the student's skills and confidence improve, the coach can increase the level of demand and challenge. This progression involves increasing the distance between the coach and the student, from white-line to white-line, which provides more space for the student to practice and refine their shots. With the increased distance between the coach and the student, the padel racket allows the student to execute shots with better control and precision.

The student's technical evolution progresses as they face greater challenges with increased distance and use of the padel racket. The student must now combine their various technical skills, footwork, perception, ball lecture, impact point, and more, to successfully hit the ball.

The coach introduces more complex drills and challenges to test the student's technical abilities and depth of understanding. This may involve practicing shots from different court positions and situations to ensure the student can handle varying game scenarios.

The second stage of training, characterised by an interaction between the padel trainer and the student, is a crucial step in bridging the gap between controlled practice and real game situations for amateur players. This stage introduces a more dynamic and realistic training environment, challenging the student to handle a small quantity of balls exchanged with the coach.

In this stage, the coach and the student interact with each other by exchanging a small number of balls, usually 1 to 3 at a time. This creates a more dynamic practice scenario that closely resembles the real gameplay. The training scene becomes closer to an actual playing circumstance, providing a significant challenge for the amateur player. This closer simulation helps the student adapt to real-game situations more effectively.

The coach adjusts the ball speed and intensity of play to a level that the student can handle while still presenting an acceptable level of ball control. By focusing on exchanging a small quantity of balls, the student starts building essential ball exchange skills, such as anticipating the ball's trajectory, positioning on the court, and decision-making.

This stage acts as a bridge between more controlled practice methods, like hand-thrown balls or balls from a basket, and fully live ball exercises where the student faces unpredictable shots and situations. The student starts developing court awareness, learning to read the game, and understanding the importance of tactical positioning and shot selection.

This stage plays a crucial role in preparing the student for more advanced training and real-game situations. The gradual progression from controlled drills to interactive ball exchanges helps the student build confidence, adaptability, and resilience in their padel gameplay. The coach's role is to provide appropriate challenges and guidance, ensuring that the student continues to grow and improve as they advance through this stage of training.

### When should we start with live ball exercises?

Initiating live ball exercises in padel is a crucial step in a student's training, and it should only be done when the student meets specific criteria regarding their technical, tactical, physical, and mental attributes. These criteria ensure the student can handle challenges presented by live ball exercises and derive maximum benefit from this phase of training.

The student should demonstrate a solid level of technical proficiency, including the ability to control various variables such as ball direction, speed, height, depth, posture, grip and comfortable impact zone. This level of control is crucial in handling the unpredictability of live ball exchanges.

The student needs to comprehend basic tactical concepts, like maintaining consistency and minimizing unforced errors, by exchanging at least eight balls over the net with the coach. This indicates the student's ability to sustain rallies and apply basic tactics during gameplay.

To meet the demands of dynamic gameplay, students undergoing live ball exercises must have adequate levels of physical fitness that include endurance, speed, and agility. This ensures that students can keep pace with the demands of dynamic gameplay.

Maintaining mental resilience is crucial for students to cope with challenging emotions and experiences that arise while learning. To persevere through frustrations, anxieties, and other emotions that may arise during live ball exercises, students must have mental strength.

It is important to note that the criteria for fitness levels and emotional resilience may vary based on the individual student's progress, dedication, and natural abilities. Padel coaches must carefully evaluate each student's readiness for live ball exercises and provide tailored guidance and support to help them achieve the required standards.

Live ball training creates a realistic and dynamic training environment where students can apply their technical and tactical skills in real game situations. When the student meets the required criteria, they can benefit greatly from this phase of training. This further improves their padel skills and enhances their understanding of the sport. The coach should create a supportive and challenging environment that encourages students to continuously improve and grow in their padel journey.

## Alternatives to the Basket

The use of the basket in training is one of the most commonly used techniques in padel, tennis and other racket sports. There are two types of basket that are often used: the traditional basket and the waist basket.

When using the traditional basket, there are two basic things to remember. Firstly, the basket must be placed at an angle that allows the coach access to the basket to make it easier to throw the ball. Secondly, the basket must be on the side of the coach's non-dominant hand so that the exercise can be carried out quickly. The use of the traditional basket is often considered as an "anchor", as it doesn't allow the coach the same mobility and variability of positions as the waist basket.

The waist basket is an alternative to the traditional basket that allows the coach greater mobility on the pitch. It is a more dynamic method as it offers different angles of reception and reaction for the students, replicating possible game situations in a more realistic way.

It's important that the coach chooses the most appropriate tool for the objectives set for each lesson and for each student.

Another tool that coaches use in padel lessons is the tube. This technique consists of throwing balls through a tube placed over the shoulder of the coach, who drops the balls and then hits them to the student.
