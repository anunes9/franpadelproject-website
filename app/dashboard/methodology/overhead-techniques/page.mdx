# Overhead Techniques
## Bandeja

It is crucial to dispel the misconception that the "Bandeja" shot initiation must resemble a waitress carrying a tray. Presently, the bandeja is executed with a preference for a flat stroke on the ball as opposed to a slice shot. The shot consists of approximately 60% flat stroke and 40% slice stroke.

Metaphorically, in this shot, the attacker holds a positional advantage over the opponent, enabling the ball to be struck from a vantage point. This advantageous position is contrasted with the opponent team's defensive stance in a ready position to defend. Exploiting this vantage point, the shot's preparation should not be overly telegraphed, allowing for an element of surprise. Consequently, the direction and power of the shot can be strategically chosen based on the opponents' positions.

The preparatory stance somewhat resembles a volley with a high elbow and an arm amplitude that does not extend beyond the back line.

The impact axis, pictured perpendicular to our body and extending from the legs to the head, follows a clock movement, commencing at 12 o'clock. To optimise impact on the ball, it is ideal for the contact to occur between 2 o'clock and 3 o'clock. Moreover, the angle at which the racket's face strikes the ball should be centred within the first and third quadrants. For the termination phase, the contact point should fall slightly below the left side of the lower chest. The orientation of the point of impact is determined by the clockwise direction, represented on the y-axis, particularly in quadrant 1.

As a player, it is imperative to adapt a Backhand grip to effectively execute a slice shot in the first quadrant. The rationale behind this approach lies in ensuring that the impact point remains within the security threshold and does not exceed the 3 o'clock mark or drop below it. This is because any impact below this threshold divulges substantial information to the opponent about our shot possibilities, compromising the efficiency of our bandeja shot. Additionally, striking the ball below this threshold may result in the ball floating in the air, leading to potential ball-out scenarios or presenting the opponents with counter-attacking opportunities. On the other hand, by hitting the ball within our security threshold, we gain a broader spectrum of directions and power that we can strategically choose based on the opponent's positional pressure. Notably, the position of the racket face significantly influences the desired direction of the shot.

Typically, the bandeja shot arises as a counter to an opponent's lob shot, inducing a seamless transition from an offensive stance to a defensive one with a regressive motion to hit the ball and quickly get back to a stable position for the next shot.

Firstly, we start the movement by rotating the lower support limb, the right leg, while slightly bending the knees and lifting the glutes. At the same time, the upper body leans forward slightly. This position is similar to the ready position, but facing the side wall. As the ball rises to its peak height, we initiate the initial displacement by performing crossed steps.

During this phase, our objective is to maximise stability. Therefore, as the ball begins its downward trajectory, we perform lateral steps as adjustment steps to create a solid and balanced foundation. Before executing the shot, it is important to separate the lower limbs beyond shoulder width to achieve an optimal base and facilitate efficient weight transfer onto the ball. Our aim is to place the ball on our right side, between our shoulders, in the first quadrant. We can imitate this movement by imagining that we are lifting a box to catch the ball. This will give us a good point of reference for the distance of the shot with the ball.

On impact, the trajectory of the body should be aligned with the intended direction of the shot, facilitating precision and control over the movement of the ball. With a stable position and a good transfer of weight to the shot, we can quickly get back into a good position to deal with the next shot.

## Vibora

The "Vibora" is a shot usually used in 3 aspects, offensive, maintaining the position or recovery.

The attacking Vibora is characterised when the player has a stable position and is able to perform a comfortable weight transfer on the ball, in which the increase in ball speed can be 4 or 5, and will move quickly to the new position he wants to conquer. The factor that will define the vibora as recovery or acceleration will be the stability of the player's base before impact. The more stable the player is before hitting the ball, the faster he will be able to move to the new position.

The maintenance vibora is defined by an unstable position that requires the player to reduce the speed of the shot in order to regain the tactical position for the next shot.

The recovery vibora is characterised by a lack of stability, typically with the body leaning backwards. This creates a total imbalance in the technical execution of the shot. This instability can be easily recognised by the opponent, who reacts to the hit by moving closer to the net in order to counter the shot. In this situation, the vibora shot is executed with the lower arm and the wrist, with the coordination of an eccentric force, and the player is forced to regain the game in the defensive zone.

The Vibora shot is characterised by the rotational aspect it incorporates, achieved by striking the ball in the first quadrant and finishing the shot in the fourth quadrant, resembling a brushing movement through the ball. From a technical point of view, the point of contact is in the first quadrant, between 1 o'clock and 2 o'clock, resulting in a higher point of impact than the bandeja shot.

To prepare for the Vibora shot, the player assumes a stance similar to a military salute, with the face of the racket facing the ground and the tip of the racket facing the opponent's court. The elbow is high and forms an angle of more than 90 degrees with the body, while the forearm forms an angle of 45 degrees with the arm.

During the follow through, the movement ends slightly higher than the left shoulder, allowing a controlled and dynamic execution of the shot. The rotational nature of the Vibora shot allows players to apply spin and precision, adding versatility to their offensive shots on the court.

## Smash
### Flat (Winter or Bomba)

The "Fast Smash", also known as the "Winter Smash" or "Bomba", is a high speed shot in padel. The execution of this shot requires a well-structured technique to maximise its effectiveness.

In order to execute the Fast Smash, players should adopt a "bow and arrow" stance, where the racket is pulled back, much like the string of a bow. The positioning of the ball is crucial, ideally at or around forehead level and must be hit in front of the body. Once the ball is struck, the follow-through movement of the racquet simulates the action of hurling an axe, generating considerable power and speed.

This shot is most strategically used when facing a high lob from the opponent. The aim is to catch the opponent off guard while they are repositioning themselves. The Fast Smash is designed to deliver a quick and surprising ball, limiting the opponent's reaction time and potentially resulting in a winning shot.

### Lifted (By 3 - side wall)

Like the "Vibora" shot, the "Lifted Smash" has the military salute preparation, which should start when the ball starts to deflect A very common mistake is that the player is already prepared, but the ball hasn't reached the maximum height of the parabola of its trajectory, which causes him to lose the fluidity of his biomechanics, performing the shot in 2 steps, preparing to salute and hitting the ball.

The smash shot, also known as the smash by 3, is a technically demanding shot in padel, as it necessitates excellent coordination between the lower and upper limbs, precise spatial awareness, and timing of execution. The technical pattern for executing a successful smash shot involves the following key points:

Anticipation is crucial in preparing for the smash shot. The player needs to read the opponent's shot and move quickly to position themselves correctly under the descending ball. Proper footwork is essential to get into the ideal hitting position.

As the ball descends, the player needs to align their body to position the ball in the first quadrant between 12 o'clock and 2 o'clock ( for left-handed players it should be between 11 o'clock and 12 o'clock). The non-hitting arm should be extended for balance and to provide stability during the shot, pointing to the glass 1 or 2 in order to allow the correct rotation of the hips and the right arm on the ball. The player should hit the ball at the highest point possible, just before it starts to drop significantly. Making clean and accurate contact with the ball is essential for a successful smash. The face of the racket should go through the ball from 12 o'clock to 3 o'clock, brushing the ball.

In the initial phase of the movement the lower limbs are at shoulder width and just before executing the two feet are brought together to lift the body towards the ball. A well-executed smash shot requires a quick and explosive transfer of weight from the back foot to the front foot. This weight transfer adds power to the shot.

After hitting the ball, the follow-through should extend fully to complete the shot's motion.

The most common mistake in this technique is represented when the player tries to hit the ball between 11 and 12, when the correct position should be between 12 and 2. The player ends up creating an optical illusion through the inclination of the body, visually enhancing the ball in the correct sector.

Players tend to confuse power with fluidity. The technical movements are based on the player's ability to execute a high intensity shot in a short space of time, enhanced by the ability to transfer weight from the lower limbs to the shot. This movement is called dynamic balance. Most athletes tend to generate a stiffness in the limbs and the imbalance is represented by a robotic dynamic that prevents the player from transferring all his strength to the ball.

### By 4 (back wall)

The "Smash by 4" is a shot recognised for its pivotal role as the end result of a well-executed, strategic offensive manoeuvre by the attacking team. This shot is typically used as a point-closing shot, executed in Sector 3 of the court.

The defining characteristic of the Smash by 4 is the precise bending of the wrist along the vertical axis. This intricate wrist movement is instrumental in sending the ball towards the back wall, leaving the opponent no chance to react. It is a highly technical and finesse shot that, if executed with precision, can win a point for the attacking team.

## Ball to the fence (Rulo)

The "Ball to fence" or "Rulo", is a direct continuation of the "Lifted Smash" and its preparation is similar to the "Winter Smash" adopting the "bow and arrow" preparation.

The special feature of the "Ball to the fence" is the player's adaptation to the opponent's lob, which demands an arching of the back in order to hit the ball. The speed of the ball must be carefully managed, with the player's visual assessment of the opponent's positioning being the key factor.

The speed of execution falls into two categories: slow, marked 2 and 3, or fast, marked 4 and 5. The choice between these speeds depends on the position of the opponent. If the opponent is close to the white line and leaning towards the side glass, indicating a preference for letting the ball bounce rather than attempting a block, the optimal approach is to play the ball at the union of the glass and the fence, making it difficult to defend.

Conversely, if the opponent positions himself closer to the net, indicating an intention to block the ball, the player should hit a fast ball, making it difficult for the opponent to successfully block or time his defensive move. The execution of the fence ball exemplifies the strategic nuances of padel, driven by dynamic responses to the opponent's position and intentions on the court.
