# Understanding the field
## Field tactical zones (defensive zone, transition zone, offensive zone)

The defence zone in padel is divided into three distinct areas: the green zone, the yellow zone, and the red zone. These zones, also referred to as positional defence, are determined by specific court boundaries.

**Green Zone:** The green zone is the first section of the defence area, starting from the midpoint of the first sector of the fence and extending to the midpoint of the first side glass. In this zone, players experience a sense of comfort and safety and have a high level of control over their opponent's actions. It offers a favourable position for defending and counter-attacking.

**Yellow Zone:** Positioned between the second half of the first side glass and the first half of the second side glass, the yellow zone is considered a neutral zone. Here, the level of danger and comfort depends on the opponent's ability to create pressure and the player's defensive skills. Players need to be alert and adaptable in the yellow zone in order to respond effectively to their opponents.

**Red Zone:** The red zone represents the final metre of the court, comprising the second half of the second side glass. It is the most dangerous zone to defend, as players face a high likelihood of losing the point or compromising their positional defence due to intense pressure from the opponents. In the red zone, players have limited control over the defensive situation, and their shot options are restricted. The primary objective here is to select a shot that facilitates a transition into the yellow or green defensive zones, allowing the player to regain a more advantageous position.

The defensive strategy in padel revolves around effectively navigating these defence zones. Players must be aware of their positioning on the court and adapt their shot selection accordingly to mitigate risk and maintain control during rallies. A well-executed shot from the red zone can facilitate a progressive or immediate transition to safer zones, providing players with an opportunity to regain their defensive composure and strategic advantage.

The offensive zone is aligned with the same color pattern as the defensive zone but in reverse order. The color scheme directly reflects the player's mindset, offering a clear indication of their potential to secure a point.

**Green Zone:** Within the green zone, players find themselves in a comfort zone. In this phase, the attacker's primary objective is to maintain a strong net position while gradually pressuring the opposing team, driving them deeper into their defensive zone. Here, finishing opportunities are low, as the attacker and defender are evenly matched in terms of positioning and control.

**Yellow Zone:** As we transition to the yellow zone, the attacking player assumes a more offensive stance. This shift enables an increase in their likelihood of successfully finishing the point. The player seizes the opportunity add pressure into the opponent, paving the way for more decisive and potentially point-winning moves.

**Red Zone:** In the red zone, the odds of finishing the point are significantly elevated. In this high-pressure arena, the attacking player has effectively pushed their opponents into the last meter of the court. The high pressure exerted by the attacking team limits the chances of the defending team to effectively defend or counter-attack. This is where the attacking player has the greatest potential to secure the point with a well-executed shot or strategy.

Understanding how to navigating between these zones is imperative to achieving success in padel. Players who comprehend the nuances of these zones and can adapt their strategies, choose correctly where to play the ball and keep the pressure on the opponent's team, maximize their chances of winning the point and, ultimately, securing a victory.

## Definition of the Fence

In a Padel court, the fence is structured into three distinct sectors, each sector number correlating with the shot intensity, all while keeping in mind the overarching objective of maintaining net positioning and winning the point. Sector 1 is situated closest to the service line, and to gain or retain the net positioning, players should execute deep shots at speed levels 1 and 2. This strategic approach serves to push the opposing defensive team backward.

As we transition into Sector 2, players can intensify their shots in their to secure the net position, thereby escalating shot intensity to levels 3 or 4. The strategic intent here is to exert greater pressure on the opposition.

Upon entering Sector 3, it signifies a heightened likelihood of employing maximum shot velocity. This strategic choice minimizes the opponent's reaction time and greatly enhances the changes of winning the point.

Quanto mais proximo o jogador estiver da linha branca, usando as escalas de velocidade, o jogador deve aplicar velocidades baixas mas com alta profundidade de modo a conquistar a zona ofensiva, velocidades 1 e 2. o Setor 2 signifca que o individo pode aumentar a intensiade da bola entre 3 e 4 para criar pressao na defesa e conquistar a rede. Quando um jogador se encontra dentro do setor 3 da malha, significa que este tem uma grande possibilidade de aplicar uma velocidade maxima estando numa zona de conclusao do ponto, na qual a reacao do adversario é bastante reduzida e existe uma maior facilidade de finalizar o ponto.%%

## Glasses

In Level 1 of Fran's methodology, the definition of glasses is presented in a simplified way, as this is an introductory approach aimed at beginners. In this initial phase, the aim is to simplify the concept of the glasses and make it easier to learn, with the aim of achieving a higher success rate and, consequently, a higher retention rate.

The padel court has a total of 18 glasses, 9 on each side of the court. These can be divided into two groups: the back glass and the side glass.
We call glass 3 the central glass of the back wall; glasses 2 are the glasses next to glass 3 (central glass); glasses 1 are the ones in the corners.
The same designation applies to the side walls, where glasses 1 corresponds to the glasses immediately after the side fence and glasses 2 are the ones connecting to the back wall.

Glasses 2 can be used as building glasses for the attacking team, or as counter-attacking glasses for the defending team. The attacking team must play a ball with an intensity between 1 and 3 (on a scale of 1 to 5), creating a ball with a lower rebound on the glass to ensure the opponent's movement. The defending team can take advantage of a ball with a higher rebound to counter-attack.

Glass 3 is considered a joker glass because it can be used in several different ways. Depending on the intensity and effect that the player applies to the ball, it can be used as a building glass, an offensive glass or a defensive glass. In padel, the glasses must be used strategically, taking into account the different functions assigned to each one, in order to maximise the success of the game.
